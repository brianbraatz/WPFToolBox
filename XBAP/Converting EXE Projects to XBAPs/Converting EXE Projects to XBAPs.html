In a 
<a href="http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%21167AD7A5AB58D5FE%211553.entry">recent post, Rob Relyea</a> contemplates the question “Are XBAPs next generation ActiveX?”
</p>
<p>
That question is way too metaphysical for my tastes, but I do know that
sometimes a developer might want to convert a WPF project from
generating an EXE to generating an XBAP. That’s what this blog posting
is all about.
</p>
<p>
Some background for newcomers:
</p>
<p>The Windows Presentation Foundation supports three distinct types of
executables. First, there is the traditional EXE file, which can do
anything that .NET allows it to do plus more through interoperability
with the Win32 API.
</p>
<p>Secondly, there are XAML files. These are text markup files with the
extension .XAML, and they run in Internet Explorer. Although XAML files
are quite powerful graphically—they can do 3D animation, for
example—they cannot contain any C# code for the often-necessary chores
of handling events from controls.
</p>
<p>And thirdly, there is the XBAP. (This stands for “XAML Browser
Application.” In my head I pronounce it as “eks bap” which makes it
sound rather silly. At one time, these things were known as XAPP’s,
which sounds rather hipper to me.) XBAP applications are somewhere
between EXEs and XAML files. They can contain code as well as markup,
and they are compiled, but they run in Internet Explorer much like XAML
files. These applications cannot contain elements of type <i>Window</i>. They use <i>Page</i>
instead, and they are run in a sandbox that prohibits from messing with
the user’s machine in devious ways. XBAPs generally run over the Web
and are generally not installed on local machines.
</p>
<p>In Visual Studio you choose rather you want an EXE or an XBAP when
you first create a project. From the New Project dialog box you pick
either “Windows Application (WPF)” or “XAML Browser Application (WPF)”.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you’re developing an EXE application and you realize “Hey,
I’m not doing anything in the app that will prevent it from running in
the browser as an XBAP so maybe I want to go that route.”
</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you prefer developing an application as an EXE because
of better debugging facilities, and then you want to convert it to an
XBAP for distribution.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you’ll probably need to change several aspects of your application, and in particular, you’ll need to change <i>Window</i> and <i>NavigationWindow</i> to <i>Page</i>.
But that’s not really what I want to discuss here. I want to talk about
changes you’ll need to make in the.CSPROJ project file, and for this I
was helped by the documentation topic “How to: Create a Sample Project
File for a Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Application”
which is located in the documentation at:
</p>
<ul>
.NET Framework Development<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Presentation Foundation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Development<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build and Deploy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How-to Topics
</ul>
<p>Some of the changes you need to make to the .CSPROJ file can be made
by selecting various options in the Project Properties pages, which you
can invoke by right-clicking the project name in the Solution Explorer
and selecting Properties, or by selecting Properties from the Project
menu.
</p>
<p>However, you’ll also have to edit the .CSPROJ file manually, and you
can do this directly in Visual Studio. First, right click the project
name in the Solution Explorer and select Unload Project. Or select
Unload Project from the Project menu. Then, right-click the project
name and select the option to Edit the .CSPROJ file. When you’re done
editing it, you can save it, or just select Reload Project and you’ll
be prompted to save the edited project file. (Basically, you can’t be
editing the .CSPROJ file and doing anything else with the project at
the same time.)
</p>
<p>
Here are the steps to convert a project from EXE to XBAP (after you create a backup copy first, of course):
</p>
<p>
Step 1.  Edit the .CSPROJ file and insert the following lines in the first <i>Project/Property Group</i> section. You can insert them right after the <i>OutputType</i> element, for example:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller;">
&lt;HostInBrowser&gt;true&lt;/HostInBrowser&gt;<br>
&lt;StartAction&gt;Program&lt;/StartAction&gt;<br>
&lt;StartProgram&gt;$(WINDIR)\System32\PresentationHost.exe&lt;/StartProgram&gt;<br>
&lt;ApplicationExtension&gt;.xbap&lt;/ApplicationExtension&gt;<br>&lt;StartArguments&gt;-debug
"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\bin\$(Configuration)\$(AssemblyName)$(ApplicationExtension)"&lt;/StartArguments&gt;
</ul>
<p>
The <i>StartArguments</i> element should be written as a single
line because it denotes a directory path. (IE seems to want to break
the long line after an embedded right parenthesis.) Also, this is XML
so remember: Case matters! Also, make sure the <i>ApplicationExtension</i> element goes before the <i>StartArguments</i> element, because it refers to the <i>ApplicationExtension</i> element.
</p>
<p>
The next three steps can be done with the Project Properties pages.
</p>
<p>
Step 2. Select the Signing tab. Check the <b>Sign The ClickOnce Manifests</b> option. Click the <b>Create Test Certificate</b>
button. Just click OK without entering a password. (This creates a
temporary manifest key that is referenced in the project file.)
</p>
<p>
Step 3. Select the Security tab. Make sure the <b>Enable ClickOnce Security Settings</b> option is checked. Select the <b>This Is A Partial Trust Application</b> option. In the <b>Zone Your Application Will Be Installed From</b> drop-down, select <b>Internet</b>. (This changes the <i>TargetZone</i> element in the project file to Internet.) Click the <b>Advanced</b> button. Uncheck <b>Debug This Application With the Selected Permissions Set</b>.
</p>
<p>
Step 4. Select the Publish tab. Check the <b>The Application Is Available Online Only</b> option. (This changes the <i>Install</i> element in the project file to false.)
</p>
<p>
Step 5. Unload the project and edit the .CSPROJ file again. You’ll probably see the <i>ApplicationExtension</i> element has been moved down near the bottom of the first <i>Project/PropertyGroup</i> section. Move it back so it comes before the <i>StartArguments</i> element.
</p>
<p>
Step 6. In the References section under the project in the Solution Explorer, delete the following:
</p>
<ul>
System.IdentityModel<br>
System.Runtime.Serialization<br>
System.ServiceModel
</ul>
<p>
And that should do it. (And I suspect that the next version of Visual Studio will reduce this entire job to a single check box.)
