Avalon Tablet guy Shawn A. Van Ness noted that a certain WPF book
already on the streets has nothing to say about Tablet PC programming,
so he put together a <a href="http://www.windojitsu.com/blog/tictactoefx.html">tic-tac-toe using <i>InkCanvas</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
Because it handles rendering and stroke retention, <i>InkCanvas</i>
certainly ranks as the high-level approach to collecting ink in WPF
programs. WPF also has a facility to use stylus plug-ins, allowing the
low-level stylus stuff we can do with the Tablet under WinForms and
which I discussed in my <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/12/TabletPC/">MSDN article on Real-Time Stylus programming</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, WPF also has a middle way that I've come to like very much. The <i>UIElement</i> class defines a whole bunch of stylus events (and related <i>On</i> methods and a few properties) that are very, very similar to mouse events. Thus, <i>StylusEnter</i>, <i>StylusDown</i>, <i>StylusMove</i>, <i>StylusUp</i>, <i>StylusLeave</i>,
to name only the most common. These are all routed events, of course,
so you have the same flexibility that you have with handling keyboard
and mouse events. To use the stylus events, a program must be running
on a Tablet PC and (very important) make a call to <i>Stylus.Enable()</i>.
(Although the stylus generates mouse events as well as stylus events on
the Tablet PC, the opposite is not true. The mouse does not generate
stylus events on a non-Tablet PC. <i>InkCanvas</i> works with both the stylus and the mouse because it specifically traps both types of events.)
</p>
<p>
A year or so ago, I became obsessed with rendering drop-shadow on stylus input and wrote an <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/RealTimeDropShadow/">online article about it</a>.
I have now returned to that crazy task for my WPF book and found the
whole job much, much easier. As with most WPF graphics jobs, the
minimal-redraw retained-graphics system helps out enormously.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/ShadowTheStylus.csproj">ShadowTheStylus.csproj</a> and <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/ShadowTheStylus.cs">ShadowTheStylus.cs</a> files were developed under the December CTP. The program creates a <i>Canvas</i> panel for the window content, and the window overrides the <i>OnStylusDown</i>, <i>OnStylusMove</i>, and <i>OnStylusUp</i>
methods rather than installing event handlers. Because these are routed
events, the canvas gets notified of the events first, and then the
window if the canvas doesn't handle the event. (Actually, after you've
drawn on the window, there will likely be various <i>Polyline</i> elements that have first dibs on these events.) And, of course, as with the keyboard and mouse, there are <i>Preview</i> versions of these events that begin at the window and go down the tree. 
</p>
<p>
In response to an <i>OnStylusDown</i> call, the program creates two <i>Polyline</i>
objects â€” one for the foreground stroke and the other for the shadow.
These are given rounded ends and joins for smoother rendering. The two
elements are then added to the <i>Children</i> collection of the <i>Canvas</i>.
But for proper composite rendering, these children must be ordered in a
specific manner. Children early in the collection get drawn first, and
are possibly obscured by children later in the collection. For this
program, the collection must contain all the shadows first, followed by
all the foreground strokes.
</p>
<p>The program manages this feat by inserting the shadow polyline in
the middle of the collection (which will always have an even number of
elements at this point):
</p>
<ul>
<pre>canv.Children.Insert(canv.Children.Count / 2, polyShadow);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
The foreground stroke can then go on the end:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>canv.Children.Add(polyStylus);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Once that's done, everything else is a snap. Notice that the program captures the stylus by calling <i>CaptureStylus</i> (so the stylus can drift outside the window) and sets its own <i>isDrawing</i> flag to <i>true</i>. The <i>OnStylusMove</i>
method simply adds an additional point each to the foreground and
shadow polyline, and lets WPF worry about the flicker-free redraw. I've
allowed the stroke to be aborted with a press of the Escape key, and
the override of <i>OnLostStylusCapture</i> is then reponsible for removing the two polylines from the <i>Children</i> collection in that case.
</p>
<p>
And now, a confession: Because I much prefer programming on a 21"
monitor with an ergonomic keyboard, I first wrote the program on my
desktop machine to use the mouse, and then converted it to the stylus
for my Tablet PC. The conversion wasn't quite a search-and-replace from
"Mouse" to "Stylus" but it was nearly so, clearly demonstrating the
similarity between the mouse and stylus event APIs.
