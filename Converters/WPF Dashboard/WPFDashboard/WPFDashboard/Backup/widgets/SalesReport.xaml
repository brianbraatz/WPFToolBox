        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We distribute our products primarily through the following channels: OEM; distributors and resellers; and online services. Our six major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the North American Region; the Latin American Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA); Japan; the Asia-Pacific Region; and Greater China.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>OEM.</Bold> Our operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to build computing devices based on our operating systems, principally PCs. Under similar arrangements, we also market and license certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software products to OEMs. We have OEM agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including Acer, Dell, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, NEC, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors operating in local markets.

          <Bold>Distributors and Resellers.</Bold>
          We license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the end-user customer to acquire multiple licenses of products. Organizations license our products primarily through large account resellers (LARs), direct market resellers, and value-added resellers. Many organizations that license products through enterprise agreements (EAs) now transact directly with us, with sales support from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. These Enterprise Software Advisors typically are also authorized as LARs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LARs are primarily engaged with large organizations and value-added resellers typically reach the breadth of small and medium-sized organizations. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include Software Spectrum, Software House International, Dell, CDW, and Insight Enterprises. Our business solutions software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets, including Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they are as follows:
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Open.</Bold> Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations (5 to over 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer’s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (generally two years). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software product over the contract period is called Software Assurance. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Under the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, or licenses with Software Assurance. They can also renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Select.</Bold> Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations (greater than 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer’s election, Software Assurance, which consists of rights to future versions of certain software products, support, tools, and training over a specified time period (generally three years). Similar to the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>          
          <Bold>Enterprise Agreement.</Bold> The Enterprise Agreement is targeted at medium and large organizations that want to acquire perpetual licenses to software products for all or substantial parts of their enterprise, along with rights to future versions of software products, support, tools, and training over a specified time period (generally three years).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Enterprise Subscription Agreement.</Bold> The Enterprise Subscription Agreement (ESA) is a time-based, multi-year licensing agreement. Under an ESA, customers acquire the right to use the current version of software products and the future versions that are released during the three-year term of the agreement. At the end of the term, customers may either renew their ESA or exercise a buy-out option to obtain perpetual licenses for the latest version of the covered products. If they do not elect one of these options, then all previously covered software must be uninstalled.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Services.</Bold> We distribute online content and services through MSN and other online services. MSN delivers Internet access and various premium services and tools to consumers. MSN also delivers online e-mail and messaging communication services and information services such as online search and premium content. Home and Entertainment operates the Xbox Live service which allows customers to participate in the gaming experience with other subscribers online. Microsoft Business Solutions operates the Microsoft Small Business Center portal, which is delivered online. This portal provides tools and expertise for small-business owners to build, market, and manage their businesses online. Other services delivered online include Microsoft Developer Networks (MSDN) subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions.

            Customers
          </Bold>
          Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet Service Providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small- and medium-sized organizations obtain our products primarily through resellers and OEMs. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10% of fiscal year 2004 and 2005 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and cover a broad array of products including Windows PC operating systems, Microsoft Office, and server products. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2003. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.

            Competition
          </Bold>
          <LineBreak />
          Every segment of the software business is competitive and subject to rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements, and changing business models. We face significant competition in all areas of our business and intense competition in many of them. Because technology advances rapidly, competitors can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. Customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive, and as concerns such as security and privacy become more important.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our direct competitors include firms that have adopted the non-commercial software model. These firms typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn their revenue on complementary services and products. This approach allows these firms to compete without having to bear the full costs of software research and development.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In a sense, we also compete with pirated copies of our own software. Global software piracy – the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products – deprives us of significant amounts of revenue on an annual basis. In addition, future versions of our products compete with the existing versions, which our licensed customers may choose to continue to use indefinitely. This means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of the factors described in this section, or as yet unidentified additional factors that may arise.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Client.</Bold> Although we are the leader in PC operating system software products, we face strong competition from well-established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market. Competing commercial software products, including variants of Unix, are supplied by competitors such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and others, which are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. Personal computer OEMs who preinstall third-party operating systems may also license these firms’ operating systems. The Linux operating system, which is also derived from Unix and is available without payment under a General Public License, has gained increasing acceptance as competitive pressures lead personal computer OEMs to reduce costs. The Microsoft Windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms and new devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers. Competitors such as Mozilla offer software that competes with the Internet Explorer Web browsing capabilities of our Windows operating system products. Apple Computer, Real Networks, and many others compete with the media playback capabilities (Windows Media Player) of our Windows operating system products. We believe current and future versions of these and other aspects of Windows will continue to compete effectively with non-Microsoft browsers, media players, and other non-Microsoft programs on important attributes such as features, functionality, and security. We believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering innovative software, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, and the largest support network for any operating system.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Server and Tools.</Bold> Our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications, offered by firms with a variety of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and others offer their own variant of Unix preinstalled on server hardware, and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system. IBM’s endorsement of Linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional Unix and Windows server operating systems. Linux’s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies supply versions of Linux, including Novell and Red Hat.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We compete in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions and middleware technology platforms. IBM and Sun Microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, and Computer Associates.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Numerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, and e-business servers. In addition, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with our collaboration and e-mail products. There are also a significant number of non-commercial software products that compete with our solutions, including the widely-deployed Apache Web Server.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our products for software developers compete against offerings from BEA Systems, Borland, IBM, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and other companies.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation, performance, total costs of ownership, productivity, applications development tools and environment, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Information Worker.</Bold> While we are the leader in business and personal productivity software applications for personal computers, competitors to the Microsoft Office System include many software application vendors such as Apple, Corel, IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Novell, Red Hat, and local application developers in Europe and Asia. IBM (Smartsuite) and Corel (WordPerfect Suite) have significant installed bases with their office productivity products. Apple may preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with our applications. The OpenOffice.org project provides a freely downloadable cross-platform application that also has been adapted by various commercial software vendors (Sun, Novell, Red Hat, IBM, and others) to sell under their brand. Corel’s suite, and many different local software suites around the world are aggressively priced for OEMs to preinstall on low-priced PCs. In addition to traditional client-side applications, Web-based offerings such as SimDesk can also provide an alternative to Microsoft Office System products.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Further, as customers have increasingly demanded additional functionality and products, including new server and service offerings, additional vendors are competing in the Information Worker segment, most notably in document management, collaboration tools, real time messaging and business intelligence. As just one example, Microsoft competes with IBM broadly in messaging and collaboration with our approach that spans multiple Information Worker products. We believe that our products compete effectively through ease of use, improving users’ personal productivity, providing tools for effective teaming and collaboration, better information management and control, and for many customers, a lower total cost of ownership than alternatives.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Mobile and Embedded Devices.</Bold> Windows Mobile software faces substantial competition from Nokia, Openwave Systems, PalmSource, QUALCOMM, and Symbian. The embedded operating system segment is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. Key competitors include IBM, Wind River, and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software. MapPoint competitors include DeLorme, MapInfo, Mapquest.com, Rand McNally, Webraska Mobile Technologies, Google, and Yahoo!. The telematics market is also highly fragmented, with competitive offerings from IBM and automotive suppliers building on various real-time operating system platforms from commercial Linux vendors, QNX Software Systems, Wind River, and others. We believe that our products compete effectively by providing a familiar development framework that enables developers to easily write and deploy innovative applications for mobile or embedded devices; providing a flexible platform that allows customers and partners to build differentiated and profitable business models; and providing end users significant benefits such as ease of use, personal productivity, and better information management and control.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <Bold>Home and Entertainment.</Bold> The home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles, frequent introductions of new products and titles, and the development of new technologies. The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition. We anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors. From time to time, we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products. Our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality and variety, timing of product releases, and effectiveness of distribution and marketing.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our Xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large established base of customers. The video game consoles have on average 5 to 7 year lifecycles. We have announced the expected release in the first half of fiscal year 2006 of a new console, the Xbox 360. Sony and Nintendo have also announced new versions of their game consoles. Success in this transition to the next generation of consoles depends on the computational power of the console, the ease of developing games for the console, the ability to provide new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content, and providing exclusive game content that is sought after by gamers. We believe the Xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in the hardware architecture, new developer tools, expanded revenue sources, and continued strong exclusive content from our 1st party game franchises such as Halo.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In addition to competing against software published for non-Xbox platforms, our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by us to develop and publish software for the Xbox console. These competitors include Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, Electronic Arts, Sega, Take-Two Interactive, Tecmo, THQ, and Ubi Soft, among others. Our PC hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners. Our MSTV business faces competition primarily from ad hoc, point-solutions that address sub-segments of the TV delivery platform, but do not provide end-to-end solutions for the network operator. Our largest MSTV competitors include IBM, Cisco, UTStarcom, and Siemens/Myrio.
