			    	<p>I
inadvertently created this custom panel a month ago. I wanted my
objects to be grouped together in a way similar to the way Media Player
groups items…or so I thought. My first implementation just had an x and
y offset. It also lets you specify the number of items you actually
want to show. (This is in the event you bind to a collection with a
huge amount of items. Looks silly.)</p>
<p>Today I opened Media Player and saw it doesn’t actually offset the
items but rotates them. So I threw in an item rotation property. Of
course the panel had already met my original requirements, so adding
the rotation aspect was pointless…unless I blogged about it. Maybe
somebody else can use it. So here’s some screen shots.</p>

<p>As you can see, you can get some pretty interesting layouts. If you
think you could make use of this you can download the source from the
link at the bottom of this post. (It’s about 1.5 MB because of the
images used in the example app.)</p>
<p>I should let you know that the contents of the panel resize to fit
available space when the horizontal and vertical offset are used. This
is what I needed from the panel. Unfortunately, things aren’t as nice
when you apply a rotation value. This is because I used RenderTransform
instead of LayoutTransform on the items.</p>

proper application should have proper persistence of its windows state
between sessions.&nbsp; Ummm…yeah.&nbsp; What I meant to say was…</p>
<p>Don’t you hate it when you close a window and&nbsp;the next time you
start your application it’s not in the same place?&nbsp; Or even worse:
I have a laptop&nbsp;that sits in a dock connected to two twenty-two
inch widescreen monitors.&nbsp; Each monitor is 1680×900 and I like
to&nbsp;splay&nbsp;all my applications across my 3360×900 pixels of
screen.&nbsp; This is great until I’m working in bed late at night and
half my applications open far off screen.&nbsp; (Good thing for
alt+space+m or&nbsp;I’d have gone mad.)</p>
<p>The crazy thing is how easy it is to put together a smart
window.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally&nbsp;I wouldn’t blog on&nbsp;such a simple
topic but at last count I have&nbsp;twelve frequently used applications
on my machine that&nbsp;drive me bonkers.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Yes, Times Reader
is one of them and yes I did receive your email and yes we’re going to
fix it and no I don’t&nbsp;normally keep my head up there.)</p>
<p>After performing some major grueling research, I found that there
are three typical&nbsp;ways applications on my computer remember their
state.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Normal Lazy Way
</li><li>The Kind of Smart Way
</li><li>The Smart Way </li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also a fourth way that I came up with while goofing around.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Scaling Way </li>
</ul>
<p>In case those weren’t descriptive enough I’ll go into further detail.</p>
<h3>The Normal Lazy Way</h3>
<p>This is when you don’t implement anything and just let the window run with it’s default behavior.</p>
<p>Below are screen shots of an app I put together.&nbsp; The first
image shows the state of the window on exit.&nbsp; The second image
shows the same application’s state right after it was executed.&nbsp;
The main difference being the first image is with my laptop docked to
two enormous&nbsp;1680×900 resolution monitors, while the second image
is my laptop undocked and using its puny&nbsp;1024×768 resolution
screen.</p>
<table unselectable="on" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table unselectable="on" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<tr border="0">

<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/Laptop01.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The downside to using the default functionality&nbsp;is your window
never remembers its dimensions, nor its&nbsp;placement on the
screen.&nbsp; On the plus side, your app never opens outside the
dimensions of your screen…like it does with&nbsp;the next method.</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;Kind of Smart&nbsp;Way</h3>
<p>This is where the developer tries to be smart.&nbsp; Upon
exiting,&nbsp;the app&nbsp;somehow stores the windows dimensions and
placement on the screen.&nbsp; The next time the application starts, it
uses these stored values to draw itself.&nbsp; You can see an example
of the load and save methods possibly used <a href="javascript:codePopUp('http://www.nickthuesen.com/BlogResources/070702-PersistingWindows/CodeExample01.html')">by clicking here</a>.&nbsp; If you haven’t already guessed, there’s one problem.</p>

<table unselectable="on" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p>ARRRGH!&nbsp; I know you’ve all experienced this, so don’t
try&nbsp;to deny it.&nbsp; ALT+SPACE+M…arrowkey arrowkey arrowkey
arrowkey…</p>
<p>Because of this one limitation, I’d rather&nbsp;folks just left the
default window behavior active instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or better yet,
implement it correctly!&nbsp; Like so…</p>
<h3>The Smart Way</h3>
<p>Now the smart way actually takes a little bit of brain power.&nbsp;
Instead of just loading and saving settings, you actually have to
perform some checks to make sure that when your window draws, it’s
actually on the screen.&nbsp; Before we get into details, I should
introduce you to the Virtual Screen.</p>
<table unselectable="on" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table unselectable="on" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/DualScreen03.jpg"></td>
</tr>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/Laptop03.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Virtual Screen represents the combined dimensions of all
connected monitors/screens.&nbsp; For example, the dimension of my
virtual screen when my laptop is docked is 3360×900, while my undocked
laptop and its single screen have a virtual screen with a 1024×768
dimension.&nbsp; (Same as my “Primary Screen”.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re working in WPF you can find information on your virtual screen under the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.systemparameters.aspx" target="_blank">SystemParameters</a> namespace.&nbsp; (I believe WinForms folks can find the equivalent under <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.systeminformation.virtualscreen.aspx" target="_blank">System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.VirtualScreen</a>.)&nbsp;
In my code I just use the values of SystemParameters.VirtualScreenWidth
and SystemParameters.VirtualScreenHeight.&nbsp; I use these two values
to make sure my window placement isn’t outside of my visual
screen.&nbsp; I also make sure that the width and height values of the
window are less than the dimensions of my viewable screen.&nbsp; You
can see the sample <a href="javascript:codePopUp('http://www.nickthuesen.com/BlogResources/070702-PersistingWindows/CodeExample02.html')">load and save methods here</a> or just look at the pretty picture.</p>
<table unselectable="on" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table unselectable="on" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/DualScreen04.jpg"></td>
</tr>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/Laptop04.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I know it looks like the window is outside the edge of the laptop
screen but that’s because my code moved the window from the far left to
the inside of the screen and placed it on the very edge.</p>
<p>I think this is probably the best method someone could
implement.&nbsp; Of course that didn’t stop me from fiddling and coming
up with…</p>
<h3>The Scaling Way</h3>
<p>This is pretty much the same code as the “Kind Of Smart Way” except
I don’t store the hard values of the window’s placement and
dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I store the windows proportions
relative to the virtual desktop.&nbsp; So if you close your window and
it’s taking up 25% of your vertical space and 75% of your horizontal
space, the next time you open it (even on a smaller/larger screen) it
will be proportionally smaller/larger&nbsp;to the change in screen
size, but it will still be using the same percentage of screen
space.&nbsp; Did that make sense to you?&nbsp; Yeah..me neither.&nbsp;
&nbsp;I did the same thing for placing the window.&nbsp; If you really
want to understand it, you can <a href="javascript:codePopUp('http://www.nickthuesen.com/BlogResources/070702-PersistingWindows/CodeExample03.html')">view my code here</a>.</p>
<p>There’s one reason I don’t like this simple approach.&nbsp; While it
works great when you’re going from one resolution to another, it does
look a little odd when switching from a dual monitor setup to a single
monitor.&nbsp; The following image illustrates the weirdness.</p>
<table unselectable="on" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table unselectable="on" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/DualScreen05.jpg"></td>
</tr>
<tr border="0">
<td border="0" valign="top"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/Laptop05.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since my width changes by 2336 pixels while my height only changes
by 132 pixels, the ratios became a little skewed…and so did my window.</p>
<h3>Finally…the Conclusion</h3>
<p>So I’ve just broken my first rule of blogging:&nbsp;keep it
short.&nbsp; This probably means most&nbsp;of you&nbsp;aren’t even
reading&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if&nbsp;that means my next
favorite app has smart windows, it’ll be worth it.</p>
<h3><em>UPDATE: 06/05/07</em></h3>
<p>As Franz points out in the comment section below, there’s a flaw in my code examples.&nbsp; Actually, there are two flaws.</p>
<p><strong>First Flaw I discovered:</strong>&nbsp; You don’t want to
save the windows dimensions and position when it is maximized.&nbsp;
That makes as much since as saving it when it’s minimized.&nbsp; You
want the app to have the proper restore values for when they start the
app and then “un-maximize” it.</p>
<p><strong>Second Flaw Franz Discovered:</strong>&nbsp;If the window is
maximized on a monitor that isn’t your primary monitor it will still
load maximized on your primary monitor.&nbsp; I believe this is because
I load the window settings before it is drawn so it “technically” is on
the primary screen when it is given the maximized value.&nbsp; I see
two ways of avoiding this.&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
<li>You could not call the Load method until your window is
loaded.&nbsp; The downside being your&nbsp;window will load, jump
across to the second monitor and then maximize.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of
trippy.&nbsp;
</li><li>The other solution is to remove the line in the Load method
that sets the WindowState and move it to the window’s Loaded
event.&nbsp; This has a better visual loading affect but really tears
apart the elegance of having a single load method and a single save
method.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>I choose the less elegant but better user experience for my code sample below.&nbsp; If you have a better way let me know.</p>

So there’s already people lining up around the mac store frothing at
the mouth for their iphone. I jumped on craig’s list and there are
numerous people willing to stand in line for you…for about 250 bucks.
<p><a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/360141507.html" target="_blank">iPhone - I Will wait on line for you - $250</a></p>
<p><a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/360147400.html" target="_blank">Will Wait in line for iPhone</a></p>
<p>$200 or Best Offer!!  It’s sad but I know they’ll get a better offer.</p>
<p>There’s even people willing to take it farther.</p>
<p><a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/ele/360269350.html" target="_blank">I will be yours IPHONE bodyguard!!! - $1000 (East Village)</a></p>
<p>I’d only pay someone 1000 bucks if they were willing to take a
bullet for my iphone. And they’d have to be willing to sing that
Whitney Houston song from the <em>Bodyguard </em>movie whenever I asked.</p>
<p>And to wrap this up.  Here’s a nice news video of apple lawyers bringing the smack down on a 3rd grader.</p>

			    	<p>So I just finished reading this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/technology/20soft.html">Microsoft to Alter Windows Vista</a></p>
<p>My immediate response was slight disgust. You know a ton of money is
being spent on this issue. And reading all of the quotes of legal
officers, attorney generals, janitors, etc each throwing in their
comments…it’s a bit baffling. Then I read, <em>“Richard Blumenthal,
the Connecticut attorney general, said that as a result of pressure
from the states, the Bush administration had taken a position closer to
that of the states that found merit in Google’s complaint.”</em>  I have to admit, I really liked the idea of Cheney and Bush in a heated debate over Desktop Search.</p>
<p>In the end I asked, “Who cares”. And since I was alone I had to
answer myself. “Microsoft and Google cares dummy.” And then it all made
sense.</p>
<p>Usually I’m not one to use my blog to rant about real world
situations, (just stupid things that make no sense), but immediately
after reading this article I clicked the “open my email” button in
Windows Live Messenger. Of course IE opened…despite FIREFOX BEING MY
SYSTEM’S DEFAULT BROWSER! The caps were used to indicate how annoyed I
am by this. Windows Live Messenger, Windows Live Mail (I’m testing out
the app), and Foldershare are all apps that I frequently use that
ignore my system default browser setting. So maybe there is something
to this desktop search nonsense.</p>

			    	<p>So
working for the New York Times has made nostalgic for things that were
never even a part of my life.&nbsp; Earlier today I caught myself
thinking,&nbsp;”Man, I wish I worked on an old manual
typewriter.”&nbsp; Of course I&nbsp;quickly realized any C# code
written on a manual typewriter might have some problems
compiling.&nbsp; But a quick google, (I LOVE THE INTERNET!) turned up a
few examples of people converting old typewriters into keyboards.&nbsp;
GENIUS!&nbsp; Here’s a screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.multipledigression.com/type/" target="_blank" atomicselection="true"><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/type13.jpg" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>I can still see where playing a sweet&nbsp;game of Doom might be
problematic but how fun would it be to take this sucker to work?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>P.S.&nbsp; This blog post was written with the Beta version of
Windows Live Writer.&nbsp; I was amazed at how easy it was to set up
with my Wordpress blog.</em></p>

knew I could go so long without daily internet access. I’ve been away
for two and a half weeks and I’ve come back to find a very pleasant

It made number 24 on their “100 Best Products of 2007″. That will sure

<p>-The big guy in the back is actually one of my desktop monitors.  Left it in for comparison.</p>
<p>-The next biggest guy (back right) was my dell 17” laptop. Despite
being constantly made fun of for having a large laptop, I loved the
giant thing. If the power connector on the motherboard hadn’t been bent
I would still probably use it.</p>
<p>-Next in line (back left) is my work laptop.  I think this is considered your standard laptop.  It gets me through the day.</p>
<p>-My favorite is the Fujitsu Lifebook (front right). Everyday this
little guy entertains me on the subway. I read comics, Times Reader,
and e-books. I sometimes will even watch the occasional video. I use it
to take notes in meetings or jot down random thoughts. It’s touchscreen
means I don’t need a stylus but I loose the hover effect which is no
biggie. It fits perfectly in my hand. Unfortunately, it technically
belongs to a different department at the Times and now that we’ve got
an Oqo I’m sure they’re going to want the lifebook back.</p>
<p>-Last, the insanely small Oqo2 (front left). We received this only a
few days ago so I haven’t decided what I think. I’m trying to use it
like I use the lifebook and there are some definite pros and cons. All
in all though it’s a very hip device.</p>
<p>All of these devices are either running XP or Vista and if I’m
wondering the city and can’t find an open Access Point they’ll all
smoothly connect via my phones (Cingular 3125) bluetooth connection.</p>

			    	<p>So
I found myself looking something up on MSDN the other day and I caught
myself thinking, “Man, this is really dry stuff.” Now I know if I’m
looking for a hair raising good time MSDN is probably the last place I
should look, but it got me thinking.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you can learn a new technology and even
successfully use it, but there’s always that last little bit that
doesn’t quite click into place. I usually need to get elbow deep into a
new technology and really have a go at it before I can get a good
visual idea of what I’m working with. I don’t do well until my brain
has had a chance to convert technical jargon and syntax into an
abstract concept or a “mental image” if you will.</p>
<p>I’m guessing there are at least one or two other people out there
who think like I do, so I’ve decided to attempt a series of posts that
I would have liked to have had when I was first learning WPF. Something
I could turn to AFTER I read the through the immensely large volume of
technical information out there. The idea being to help the new WPF
developer get to that, “Oooooooohhhhh, now I get it! AWESOME!” moment
we all remember experiencing. </p>
<p>These are short little write-ups that have little text and lots of
visuals. I tend to keep things pretty abstract, heavy on the metaphors,
and the concept to code/xaml ratio is very small. I’m thinking of
calling them “Nick’s Twisted Perspectives”, but that’s just because I’m
bad at coming up with names.</p>
<p>My first attempt was an super high level explanation of Styles and
Templates. I’m still not sure if I’m actually creating a usable and
informative resource so feel free to leave your loves and hates in the
comments section.</p>
<p>Since these posts will be image heavy and I don’t want to clog up
your aggregators I’ll just be providing links to separate pages.</p>

<td valign="top"> If you are an ultra geek, (or a closet ultra geek
like myself), this book is probably right up your alley. The author
does an amazing job of applying basic physics to common comic book
heroes. For example: In the first Superman comic book the author takes
the fact that Superman can jump tall buildings and using basic
principle of physics determines the mass and size of Krypton and then
shows why the planet exploded! Seriously…ultra geek reading material
here. But don’t worry, the author has a great sense of humor and rarely
bogs the reader down with over the top equations and calculations. </td>

EDIT: Fil Fortes was kind enough to point out I’ve put up a
non-bindable panel. If you want a good version of this panel you should
check out: <a href="http://fortes.com/2007/05/07/uniformpanel/" target="_blank">http://fortes.com/2007/05/07/uniformpanel/</a></strong></p>
<p>I’m guessing the following scenario hasn’t only happened to me.</p>
<p>You know how a Grid and it’s children will automatically fill all available space?</p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack01.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack02.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>How many times have you mistakenly attempted to ask StackPanel to do
the same thing? For example: I want to have six buttons span the width
of my window.</p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack03.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack04.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>Doh!  I’ve done this more times than I’d like to admit.  </p>
<p>So your probably thinking to yourself, “So just put them in a Grid
and create columns you fool! It’s easy!” And you’re right, that’s what
I usually end up doing. But what if you’re dynamically adding/removing
objects to your Grid? Then you have to create the rows/columns in code
each time a child is added or removed. What a pain! Using a Grid’s
Columns/Rows really falls apart if you need this layout to occur in an
ItemsControl and your setting the ItemsControl.ItemsPanel property! Now
you’re screwed and you’re going to have to write a custom control…like
I did.</p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack05.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack06.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>If you were able to follow the ramblings of that last paragraph then
you’ve probably figured how I built SpanningStackPanel. All I did was
inherit from Grid and then, depending on Orientation and FlowDirection,
I add Columns/Rows when a UIElement is added/removed to the Children
collection.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  I remember <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/okoboji/" target="_blank">Kevin Moore</a>
once telling me it’s not worth the overhead of inheriting from anything
other than Panel, but in this case I felt it was easier to let Grid do
the work it was already programmed to do. This way I didn’t have to
mess with any of that ArrangeOverride or MeasureOverride nonsense one
usually has when building a custom panel.</p>
<p>There were a couple of things I did to make the panel mimic some of
StackPanel’s behavior. Like I mentioned before I have Orientation and
FlowDirection properties that control the layout as seen below.</p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack07.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack08.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack09.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>And lastly, to mimic Grid’s behavior I don’t give a control more or
less space if it has a hard set Width/Height property. The following
screenshot shows the green button with it’s Width property set to 25px.</p>
<p><img src="LayeredStackPanel_files/SpanningStack10.jpg" border="0"></p>
<p>So that’s it!  A panel that acts like a StackPanel while laying out like a Grid.  </p>
<p>You can snag the source from here if you want to play around with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nickthuesen.com/BlogResources/070312-SpanningStackPanel/SpanningStackPanelExample.zip">SpanningStackPanelExample Source</a></p>
<p>At some point I’ll probably come back to this control and change the
way it determines if a control has a set height/width. I don’t like the
way I currently implemented it but it works for now. Maybe I’ll come up
with a better name then SpanningStackPanel too.
SuperUltraliciousMaskedAvengerPanel…that has a nice ring to it.</p>
