Sample for Avalon Beta 1 RC May CTP release

Purpose:

	Demostrates Multiple video's on different a meshes. 5 videos are showing, One in 2D via MediaElement, 2 on rotating planes, 1 on a sphere, and one on the inside of a cylinder. The one inside the cylinder is pointing to an Http location and the others are local.

Use:

	The Create, Begin, Stop, Pause and Resume buttons are for the 3D element for testing. I think Begin and stop works.

Notes:

	The content comes from the http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/ContentShowcase.aspx, and I created a small sample using movie maker.

	MSBuild.exe from command line or Visual Studio Beta 1
