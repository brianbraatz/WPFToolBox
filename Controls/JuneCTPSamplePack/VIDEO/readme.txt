Sample for "Avalon" WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Beta 2 RC Sept 2005 CTP release

Purpose:

	Demostrates Multiple video's on different a meshes. 3 videos are showing on 6 meshes created in ERain's Zam3D.
	In this sample, I use a VisualBrush off of a canvas Framework Element. 

Use:

	Begin, Stop, Pause, Resume, Speed work. See the eventhandlers for use. Video can be difficult to get working...you need MediaPlayer 10, the latest drivers, and some luck. 
	I've gotten video to work on mose ATI cards above a 9600.

Notes:

	The content comes from the http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/ContentShowcase.aspx, and I created a small sample using movie maker.

Building:

	MSBuild.exe from command line or Visual Studio 

Running:

	Bin\Debug\Video.exe
