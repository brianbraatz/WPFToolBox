							A blue button <br>
</p>
							<p>Inspired by a question in the newsgroups, I decided to
create a blue gel style button. Is it sacrilege? blasphemy? just poor
taste? to use XAML to create a Mac inspired button? I don't know. But I
did have fun and learned quite a bit, even though I've made several
pretty cool buttons (if I may say so myself) in XAML already.</p>
							<p>One
reason I felt so motivated was recalling the influence a particular
tutorial had on me when I first started exploring GUI graphics, etc. <a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?page=1&amp;cid=4CB81">The Ultimate Aqua Button</a>,
a tutorial by Brian Edgin, is one of the best tutorials I've ever seen
on any subject. Even though it is geared for Fireworks users, Edgin
covers a lot of the basic concepts as well. The influence this tutorial
had on me is evident in most of the computer generated art in my <a href="http://hypknotic.deviantart.com/gallery/">deviantArt gallery</a>. </p>
							<p>I
think it is important to state that my intent was not to recreate
exactly the Mac Aqua button. Nor was it to recreate any particular
tutorial. I wanted to be influenced and inspired, certainly, but in the
end this is my interpretation and an emulation of, if anything, a
conglomerate of all the blue buttons I've looked at over the last few
years. </p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>

							A small project was made to show the button in action. </p>
							<p align="left">The
challenge here was making a richly shaded button without the use of an
inner-glow bitmap or "live" effect. While it takes some getting used
to, much can be done with just gradients and opacity masks. Indeed, the
fantastic (but not yet perfect) gradient tool in Expression Interactive
Designer is extremely powerful. I did eventually cave in and use a
DropShadowBitmapEffect on the button content text. A shadow is
definetly required for the optimum look, and my options (that I could
see) were having two TextBlocks which would both require the designer
to edit them, or this solution, which allows the designer to simply
enter the content, intuitively, into the Content field of the button,
and then automatically applies a shadow.</p>
							<p align="left">The
hitch is that the bitmap effects do not scale like the vectors and
gradients. A 2-pixel shadow looks like almost too much on a typically
sized button, but is hardly noticable on larger buttons.</p>
							<p align="left">I,
personally, would not want to use this particular template in an
application. I think it looks neat enough, but also a bit over worked.
I am also not currently aware of an easy way to recolor or hue-shift
such a button--there are probably a dozen color GradientStops that
would need precise editing to make this, say, a green button.
Additionally, the reflection has to be hard coded into the code behind
(at this stage of the game), for each button.</p>
							<p align="left">In
fact, I wouldn't mind at all some input on these issues. Is anyone
aware of a simple way to say, take a Visual or Drawing brush, and shift
all the colors' hues without changing saturation or brightness? The EID
GUI has useful tools for this on an individual basis, but in the XAML
everything is defined in RGB--seems like a moderate amount of code
would have to be written by a developer just to change button colors.
(That particular complaint comes from my experince with DesktopX, which
makes it very easy to do such switches on the fly.)</p>
							<p align="left">Input
also needed on binding in templates. Could I bind a TextBlock, say, in
the template, so that it would have the same content as the button
itself, which is undefined in the template? That way I could have a
non-bitmap shadow that didn't require extra steps by a designer. Not a
big deal here, but would be useful knowledge.</p>
							<p align="left">As
far as the button behavior goes, the IsMouseOver and IsPressed states
have some behavior, but I just phoned it in. I don't know what a real
Aqua button behavior is like.</p>
							<p align="left">I hope some folks download this and give it a look. </p>
