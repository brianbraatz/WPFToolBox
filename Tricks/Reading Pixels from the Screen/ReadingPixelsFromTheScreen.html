<center><h1>Reading Pixels from the Screen</h1></center>

As I discuss in my book <i>Programming Windows with C#</i>,
the Windows Forms graphics system does not provide a way to read pixels from the screen.
If reading the screen is something you need to do, 
you'll have to make use of Win32 functions.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pwcs/CaptureScreen.cs">CaptureScreen.cs</a> file shows how to 
copy the contents of the screen into a .NET bitmap. 
(Like all Windows Forms programs, compiling the program requires references to the
System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms DLLs.) 
To use the program, simply click the client area.
The program creates a bitmap the size of the screen, 
copies the screen contents into the bitmap,
and then displays the bitmap stretched to the size of its client area.
You can use techniques shown in Chapter 11, 16, and 24 of
<i>Programming Windows with C#</i> 
to save the bitmap to a file, or copy it to the clipboard.
</p><p>
The only external Win32 function required in CaptureScreen
is the famous <i>BitBlt</i> (bit-block transfer) function.
<i>BitBlt</i> requires two devices context handles &#8212; a source and a destination.
Both device context handles can be obtained from methods provided by 
the .NET <i>Graphics</i> class.
</p><p>
The <i>OnClick</i> method of CaptureScreen begins by calling the static 
<i>Graphics.FromHwnd</i> method with an argument of zero.
(I was prompted to try calling <i>Graphics.FromHwnd</i> with a zero argument 
by the documentation of the Win32 <i>GetDC</i> function:
"If this value is NULL, <i>GetDC</i> retrieves the DC for the entire screen."
It worked!)
The <i>OnClick</i> method then creates a bitmap with the same size
and resolution of the screen. 
</p><p>
Once the bitmap is created, 
the <i>OnClick</i> method creates a <i>Graphics</i> object for the bitmap
by calling the static <i>Graphics.FromImage</i> method.
The <i>GetHdc</i> method of the <i>Graphics</i> class provides device context handles
based on both <i>Graphics</i> objects. 
At this point, <i>BitBlt</i> can be called.
The rest is just cleanup.
</p><p>
I tried to use a similar technique with the Win32 <i>GetPixel</i> function, 
but <i>GetPixel</i> mysteriously wouldn't work with that <i>hdcScreen</i> object 
that worked with <i>BitBlt</i>. 
A different approach is required that obtains a device context handle 
from the Win32 function <i>CreateDC</i>, and later deletes it with <i>DeleteDC</i>.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pwcs/WhatColor.cs">WhatColor.cs</a> file is a Windows Forms version of the
WhatClr program from Chapter 8 of my book 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html"><i>Programming Windows</i></a> 
(5<sup>th</sup> edition, Microsoft Press, 1999). 
The program sets a timer to display the RGB value of the pixel underneath the mouse position.
It's very useful for Web page designers (and others) who want to match colors to 
objects displayed on the screen. 
The C# WhatColor program is somewhat enhanced to display both the 
hexadecimal and decimal renditions of the pixel color.
</p><p>
At each timer tick, the program obtains the current mouse coordinates
using the static method <i>Control.MousePosition</i>.
It obtains a device context handle for the whole screen using <i>CreateDC</i>,
gets the pixel color from <i>GetPixel</i> and then deletes the device context handle
by calling <i>DeleteDC</i>.
</p><p>
The COLORREF value that <i>GetPixel</i> returns contains the red, green, and blue
bytes back packed into a 32-bit integer. 
The <i>TimerOnTick</i> method converts this value into a Win32 <i>Color</i> object
using the static <i>FromArgb</i> method.
</p><p>
The <i>OnPaint</i> method using <i>String.Format</i> to create a two-line string
containing the hexadecimal and decimal text renditions of the color, and
then uses <i>DrawString</i> with a <i>StringFormat</i> object to center the text in the window.
