How is it possible that a thousand-page book hits the streets only a
few months after an author finishes writing it? The simple answer is
that the publisher (Microsoft Press, in my case) doesn't wait until the
author finishes writing before starting the editing and production
process. It's a pipeline. I submit chapters in sequence as I finish
them, and then my editors get a crack at them. They turn on the Track
Changes feature in Microsoft Word and start editing. My grammar is
repaired, obscurities are clarified, transitions are smoothed, and
passive voice is eliminated. A technical editor checks out the code and
the technical content of my discussions.
</p>
<p>At that point, the edited .DOC files are returned to me for "author
review." My basic job now is answer questions that may have been left
as comments in the file, to make sure that editing didn't alter the
meaning of what I was saying (which happens only occasionally), and to
check that the code still works. These author reviews are important
because it's the best time for me to make substantial changes. The next
time I see the chapters, they are PDF files that look just like the
final book. I am discouraged from making major changes, and I can't
actually change the files. Any fixes I see I need to describe in words
("Page 5, Paragraph 3, First Line: Change 'horizontal' to 'vertical'.")
</p>
<p>I have now reviewed the edits of the first seven chapters. Those of
you who are following my progress on the book (and perhaps biting your
fingernails as much as I'm biting mine) can track my progress in the
Table of Contents section on my <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf/index.html"><i>Applications = Code + Markup</i></a> page.
</p>
<p>
The most disturbing thing that can happen during author reviews is to
discover broken code. Programs that worked fine when the chapters were
originally submitted no longer work, and the code now has to be fixed.
Sometimes it's a good thing. I knew that the <i>TextRange</i> class used in conjunction with the <i>RichTextBox</i> document had acquired handy <i>Load</i> and <i>Save</i> commands, so making that change was a pleasure.
</p>
<p>
I also knew that the <i>DatePicker</i> control was being removed from the first release of WPF, so I had to change a program that used that control to a <i>TextBox</i> and <i>DateTime.TryParse</i>.  Not quite the same!
</p>
<p>
I personally think it's <i>scandalous</i> that WPF has no date or time controls. Fortunately they haven't removed the feature where you can <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/PendulumButton.xaml">use XAML to set the current date and time in a button and then swing it like a pendulum</a>.
</p>
<p>
In checking out programs in Chapter 6, I discovered that the <i>Name</i> property defined by the <i>FrameworkElement</i>
class had somehow acquired a bunch of restrictions. The text string
cannot contain embedded blanks, it cannot begin with a number, etc. Of
course, the <i>Name</i> property is used in XAML as a variable name
for objects, but I was using it in straight code, where it's used to
locate elements through the <i>FindName</i> method. (Perhaps they've tried to overload the <i>Name</i> property with one too many uses.)
</p>
<p>
The scariest problem involved a program in Chapter 1 called <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/GrowAndShrink.cs">GrowAndShrink.cs</a> (and here's the 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/GrowAndShrink.csproj">GrowAndShrink.csproj</a> project file). This program simply increases the <i>Width</i> and <i>Height</i>
properties of the window by 10% when you press the Up key, and
decreases them by 10% when you press Down. The window is kept centered
on the screen.
</p>
<p>If your display resolution is set to 96 DPI, the program works fine.
With 120 DPI, however, it makes sudden jumps in size. In the course of
exploring this problem, I wrote <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/ClickToMakeBigger.cs">ClickToMakeBigger.cs</a> (and the 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/ClickToMakeBigger.csproj">ClickToMakeBigger.csproj</a> project file), with the following method: 
</p>
<ul>
protected override void OnMouseDown(MouseButtonEventArgs args)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Width = ActualWidth + 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Height = ActualHeight + 1;<br>
}
</ul>
<p>
The program displays the current values of these four properties in its
client area. This program also works fine on 96 DPI displays, but does
strange things with 120 DPI. I don't know what the problem is, but
pixel dimensions are getting mixed up with device-independent sizes.
It's surprising that a bug with such basic properties isn't having more
of an effect throughout the system. </p>
