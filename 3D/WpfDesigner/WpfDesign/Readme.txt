This WPF designer is a work in progress.
Lots of features are still missing, e.g. currently, you can place elements only inside a Canvas or Grid.
Some valid XAML files fail to load if they use features that are not yet implemented, e.g. data binding or markup compatibility.

The newest code can be retrieved using Subversion:
