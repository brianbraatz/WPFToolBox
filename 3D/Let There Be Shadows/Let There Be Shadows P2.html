After I posted my
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2007/03/120326.html">previous feasibility study on doing shadows in WPF 3D</a>, I received helpful emails from 
<a href="http://www.knowing.net/">Larry O'Brien</a> and 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wpf3d">WPF 3D Blogger Jordan Parker</a>, both of whom induced me to think of the problem in another way.  Thank you!
</p>
<p>
I am happy to report that this morning I implemented an approach I'm quite happy with.
</p>

The "chopper" is animated, of course. Besides actually having good
performance without jaggies on the shadow, what makes this especially
cool is that it happens to be an all-XAML solution:
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>This comes under the category of "putting the API to work."
Basically, the cyan "ground" or "floor" is covered by a second material
which is based on a <i>VisualBrush</i>, the visual being basically another <i>Viewport3D</i> that views the figures from the perspective of the <i>DirectionalLight</i>. This brush is the shadows.
</p>
<p>
This is certainly not a generalized scheme for 3D shadows. First, the
scene must be divided into figures that throw shadows and figures that
display shadows. The figures that throw shadows here are the five
"pillars" (which I originally put in to help me ensure that my math was
correct) and the "chopper." These figures do not throw shadows on each
other. The figure that displays the shadows (the "ground" in this
example) must be flat and rectangular. </p>
<p>
It also became evident to me that unless I wanted to get into some math
that my poor Friday-morning head wasn't ready for, the direction vector
of the light had to be parallel to one side of the "ground." I normally
like to use a <i>DirectionalLight</i> vector of <b>(2, -3, -1)</b> but for this file I set it to <b>(2, -3, 0)</b> so it's parallel to the XY plane.
</p>
<p>
Much of this 3D scene is defined as resources. In particular, all the
figures that throw shadows — the five pillars and the chopper — are
part of a single <i>Model3DGroup</i>.  Because this is a "model" it can be shared among multiple visuals, and indeed it is.
</p>
<p>
For the moment let me skip the final resource (of type <i>Border</i> named "lightview") and take you through the main <i>Viewport3D</i>.
It begins with the definition of the "ground," which is a rectangle on
the XZ plane centered at the origin and extending 2 units on the
negative and positive X and Z axes. That figure is covered by two <i>DiffuseMaterial</i> brushes, one of which uses a simple Cyan brush, and the other which uses a <i>VisualBrush</i> based on the "lightview" resource. The <i>Model3DGroup</i> containing the pillars and chopper becomes a single line in the <i>Viewport3D</i>. Notice that the lighting is divided equally between <i>AmbientLight</i> and <i>DirectionalLight</i> with the aforementioned <i>Direction</i> vector of <b>(2, -3, 0)</b>.
</p>
<p>
The XAML file concludes with three animations that spin the chopper around the scene.  As all of us who have been <s>poisoned</s>
inspired by the "everything is animatable" rule know, WPF 3D shadows
that can't be animated in real time have to be considered totally
worthless.
</p>
<p>
The shadowing logic is implemented entirely in that tiny "lightview" resource. As you can see, it's basically another <i>Viewport3D</i> based on that same <i>Model3DGroup</i>
containing the pillars and the chopper (but not the ground). There are
no lights, which means that the figures in this scene will be rendered
as black. This <i>Viewport3D</i> is a view of the figures from the perspective of the <i>DirectionalLight</i>. Because <i>DirectionalLight</i> is assumed to come from infinity, this <i>Viewport3D</i> uses <i>OrthographicCamera</i>. (A scene lit by <i>PointLight</i> would use a regular <i>PerspectiveCamera</i> for the shadows.)  The <i>LookDirection</i> vector is the same as the <i>Direction</i> vector of the <i>DirectionalLight</i>. The <i>Position</i> property is set so that the center of the camera view is the origin, which is the center of the ground. Because this is an <i>OrthographicCamera</i> pointing to the origin, the coordinates of the <i>Position</i>
property can be doubled or tripled with no effect on the scene. The
camera just needs to be back far enough so the figures are in front of
it.
</p>
<p>
I defined the <i>TextureCoordinates</i> for the ground so that the upper-left corner of the brush corresponds to the left-rear corner of the ground. The <i>OrthographicCamera</i> of this <i>Viewport3D</i>
is positioned at the point (-2, 3, 0) and looking towards the origin.
To make the left-rear corner of the ground correspond to the top-left
corner of the <i>Viewport3D</i> the camera has to be oriented so that the top of the camera — the <i>UpDirection</i> property — points to the negative Z axis: the vector <b>(0, 0, -1)</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Width</i> property of the <i>OrthographicCamera</i> needs to be set so that the width of the ground (which is 4 units in size) fits precisely within the width of the <i>Viewport3D</i> with the camera oriented at an angle to the ground. This is just a little trig problem, and you'll discover that <i>Width</i> should be set to 3.33. Here's a little diagram of the calculation, a cross-section looking in the -Z direction:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="Let%20There%20Be%20Shadows%20P2_files/ShadowCameraDiagram.png">
</p>
<p>
This is a crucial calculation; otherwise the shadows won't line up with the figures, 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, if you just use a <i>Viewport3D</i> as the <i>Visual</i> property of a <i>VisualBrush</i> you'll find that the visual parts of the 3D scene expand to fill the brush. For that reason, I enclosed the <i>Viewport3D</i> inside a <i>Border</i> element, which is given a particular size in device-independent units and a <i>Transparent</i> background. The actual dimensions of this <i>Border</i> are less important than its aspect ratio. I gave it a <i>Height</i> of 400 units corresponding to the 4-unit depth of the ground, and a <i>Width</i>
of 333 units corresponding the 3.33 width viewed by the camera. That
333-by-400 element is then stretched to fill the surface of the ground.
</p>
<p>
Without any lights in the <i>Viewport3D</i>, the figures are
normally rendered as black, which would make for black shadows. Ambient
light normally causes shadowed areas to be only darker that
non-shadowed areas rather than completely devoid of light, so the <i>Viewport3D</i> is given an <i>Opacity</i> of 0.5, corresponding to the 50/50 split between <i>AmbientLight</i> and <i>DirectionalLight</i> in the scene.
</p>
<p>
Although I'm happy this technique works, I am most distressed about
limiting light to directions parallel to the axes, so I hope fixing
that problem will be my next enhancement.
