I want to have an example of rendering shadows in my WPF 3D book, and I've been exploring some techniques.

<p>
This one, however, I'm going to have to classify as a failure.  You can try it out here:

I don't want to make the source code available because it's rather
sloppy and way too specific to this particular program, but I can
describe how it works:
</p>
<p>The "chopper" is just two 8-vertex boxes stuck together and moved
around with three animations: rotating around its axis, revolving
around the Y axis, and moving up and down.
</p>
<p>The "ground" is a plane surface composed of 200 by 200 rectangles,
or 80,000 triangles. Interestingly, even without the shadow logic,
increasing the number of triangles in the ground made the animation of
the chopper increasingly choppy.
</p>
<p>
The illumination is a combination of <i>AmbientLight</i> with a color of 40-40-40 and <i>DirectionalLight</i> with a color of C0-C0-C0 and a direction of <b>(2, -3, -1)</b>.
</p>
<p>
I render the shadow by manipulating the <i>Normals</i> collection of the ground during a <i>CompositionTarget.Rendering</i>
event. For each vertex on the ground, I set the vertex normal as
follows: If no shadow is to appear at a vertex, I set the normal to the
vector <b>(0, 1, 0)</b>, which is the default straight-up surface normal for the floor. For a shadow, I set the normal to <b>(3, 2, -1)</b>,
which is at right angles to the directional light. The setting of this
normal eliminates the directional light but not the ambient light from
the shadow.
</p>
<p>
Originally, I called the 3D version of <i>VisualTreeHelper.HitTest</i> for every vertex on the floor, using a <i>RayHitTestParameters</i> object based on the vertex and the negative <i>Direction</i> vector of the <i>DirectionalLight</i>.
If the ray from the floor in the negative direction of the directional
light hit the chopper, then that vertex was part of the shadow. At that
point I could set the vertex normal.
</p>
<p>
I then realized I could reduce the calls to <i>VisualTreeHelper.HitTest</i>
considerably by first determining a 2D bounding box for the shadow. I
did this by looking at rays from the vertices of the chopper — and
there are only 16 of those — to the floor using the positive <i>Direction</i> vector of the <i>DirectionalLight</i>.
Because this particular hit-test calculation only involves an
intersection of a line and a plane, I did it in code rather than
calling <i>VisualTreeHelper.HitTest</i>. This bounding box establishes
minimum and maximum X and Z coordinates on the floor within which the
shadow appears. The calls to <i>VisualTreeHelper.HitTest</i> are then restricted to that box.
</p>
<p>
I thought this was an interesting approach, and I was disappointed it
didn't work better. The jaggies on the shadow can be eliminated only by
increasing the resolution of the floor, but, of course, that tends to
slow down the whole show.
