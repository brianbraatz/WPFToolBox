When a book is in the planning stages, the publisher (with input from
the author) decides how long the book is going to be. Books generally
consist of a number of <i>signatures</i>,
which is a single sheet of paper printed and then folded multiple times
to create multiple pages. These days signatures are generally <i>octavos</i>, which are folded 3 times to create 8 leaves, each of which is printed on the front and back for 16 pages.
</p>
<p>
It was decided that my book 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf"><i>Applications = Code + Markup: A Guide to the Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation</i></a>
would have 64 signatures for a total of 1,024 pages. When an author
writes more than that (as I have a tendency to do), something must
give, and in the case of <i>Applications = Code + Markup</i>, it meant scaling back the scope of the book.

One of the chapters I wrote but which didn't make the final cut now available for downloading:
</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf/Chapter32.doc">Chapter 32. Entering the Third Dimension</a>
</p>
<p>
This is a Microsoft Word .DOC file; if you don't have Word, you can download this free 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=95E24C87-8732-48D5-8689-AB826E7B8FDF&amp;displaylang=en">Word Viewer</a> from Microsoft's web site. Here's the source code for the chapter:

</p>
<p>
This chapter is rather "raw." It was not edited by by editors at
Microsoft Press, and the diagrams (which I did directly in Word) are
rather sloppy. The art department at MS Press would obviously have
redone these. </p>
<p>
I wasn't very happy with this chapter. One problem is that a 25-page
chapter on 3D programming will barely scratch the surface. But I think
I went wrong in another way: Sometimes a writer of programming
tutorials has a choice — whether to begin a chapter with a complete
program and then describe all the pieces (such is the typical "hello,
world" approach), or to build up a complete program from snippets of
code. I chose the latter approach for the beginning of this chapter.
Consequently, the chapter flops around too much with a bunch of
confusing class hierarchies before presenting the first program. If I
had it to do over again, I'd probably do it differently. What I'm
happiest about in this chapter is that I was able to include a class
that generates a non-trivial <i>MeshGeometry3D</i>.
</p>
<p>
Even with the flaws, I hope this chapter helps people get started in
3D, and I hope I have the opportunity to write more about 3D graphics
programming in the future.
