Those of us who suffer from advanced Xamlholism can no longer even
think about a programming challenge without wondering whether it could
be done entirely in XAML. And once we are sure an all-XAML solution is
possible, we don't care how ugly or how wasteful the result may be. The
most important objective of our obsession is seeing it run in IE, and
saying proudly (or rather, <i>thinking</i> proudly, because no one else is really interested in our addiction) "I did it entirely in a single XAML file."
</p>
<p>
Not every WPF programmer has this sickness. Ian Griffiths' 
<a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2006/11/19/wpfwavedata">WPF Data Binding: Harmonic Series Visualization</a>, for example, is an elegant mix of C# code <i>and</i>
XAML. This program demonstrates proper (and admirable) programming
moderation, and there's some nice stuff in there. I particularly like
the "generation" of the <i>Slider</i> controls as data templates in an <i>ItemsControl</i>. Change one number in the program — the first argument to the <i>HarmonicSeries</i> constructor in Windows1.xaml.cs — and you get more or fewer sliders as a result.
</p>
<p>
Well, seeing this nice piece of code was enough to trigger my
Xamlholism to kick in, and I went on a binge. (And on a Sunday morning,
no less.) My goal was to do something similar, but entirely in XAML. I
toyed around with displaying a polyline, but came to the conclusion
that the XAML would just be way too repetitious, even for my low
Xamlholic standards.
</p>
<p>So, I decided to use an animation instead. What you see is a little
red dot tracing out the curve on an oscilloscope-like screen, so I
called the file:
</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/11/Oscilloscope.xaml">Oscilloscope.xaml</a>
</p>
<p>
It looks like this:
</p>

</p>
<p>The 10 sliders correspond to the first 10 harmonics, and you can set
the amplitude of each to anything from -100 to 100. There are also
three buttons down at the bottom for presets. Clicking the buttons sets
the 10 sliders for a square wave, triangle wave, or sawtooth. (Of
course, the results are only approximate because only 10 harmonics are
involved. Adding more harmonics to my solution involves a lot of ugly
cut-and-paste-and-modify.)
</p>
<p>
Before you try to figure out how this program works, you might want to look at 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/11/SingleSineCurve.xaml">SingleSineCurve.xaml</a>.
This simpler program just displays the first harmonic with a constant
amplitude of 100. It has two animations: The first simply moves the red
dot along the x-axis from left to right, repeated forever. The second
animation animates a <i>double</i> from 0 to 360, again repeated forever. The second animation targets the <i>Angle</i> property of a <i>RotateTransform</i>, which is part of a <i>RenderTransform</i> for an invisible element. That <i>RenderTransform</i> also contains a <i>ScaleTransform</i> with a fixed <i>ScaleY</i> attribute of 100. In the composite transform, the <i>M21</i> element of the matrix is equal to -100 times the sine of the animated angle. That number is bound to a <i>TranslateTransform</i> of the red dot to move it up and down.
</p>
<p>
In Oscilloscope.xaml, there's one animation for the horizontal movement of the red dot, and 10 animations for 10 <i>RotateTransform</i>s for 10 invisible elements, where each <i>RotateTransform</i> is combined with a <i>ScaleTransform</i> that's bound to one of the 10 <i>Slider</i> controls. The <i>RenderTransform</i> of the red dot is a composite of 10 <i>TranslateTransform</i>s, each of which is bound with the <i>M21</i> element of the <i>RenderTransform</i> matrix of the 10 invisible elements.
</p>
<p>
I know, I know, I know. This is totally perverted. But as an active
Xamlholic, this is the type of thing that to people like me is "having
fun."

<b>November 20 Postscript:</b> I added the buttons very late in
developing this file. I only discovered after Oscilloscope.xaml was
posted that clicking one of the buttons then renders the sliders from
being changed by hand. I'm not sure how to fix this problem, except to
refresh the file in Internet Explorer.
