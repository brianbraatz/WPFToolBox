Generally, one's first experiences with constructing a 3D scene in a <i>Viewport3D</i>
element are not satisfying. Very often you won't see anything at all,
and then you'll realize you forgot the camera, or the light, or
everything you once learned about vectors in a college physics course.
</p>
<p>And then, when you finally do see something, it's not quite like you
pictured it. You wanted a simple pyramid or a cube, and what you've
gotten is some odd diamond shape that doesn't look three dimensional at
all.
</p>
<p>
Here are a few hints to have a more satisfying 3D experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Use directional lighting.  Often people start out with <i>AmbientLight</i>
because it's simple, and then wonder why everything is illuminated
equally. Generally you'll want a combination of ambient and directional
lighting. A simple starting point is a fifty-fifty split between the
two, where the directional lighting comes in at an angle from the
upper-left-rear octant:
<p>
</p><ul style="font-family: monospace;">
&lt;AmbientLight Color="Gray" /&gt;<br>
&lt;DirectionalLight Color="Gray" Direction="1, -3 -2" /&gt;
</ul>
</li>
<p>
</p><li>Move the camera. If your 3D figure is symmetric around the
orgin, generally you'll want the camera to be a bit off center. You can
still point the camera at the origin by setting the coordinates of the <i>LookDirection</i> attribute to the negative of the <i>Position</i> attribute.
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
Understand how default normals of the <i>MeshGeometry3D</i>
are calculated, which will probably persuade you that for figures with
flat faces (such as cubes and pyramids and other polyhedra), do <i>not</i> share vertices among faces unless you want the edges to be smoothed and the faces to blend in with each other.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
An example:  The 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-DiscreteVertices.xaml">Dodecahedron-DiscreteVertices.xaml</a> file displays a dodecahedron centered around the origin, and here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="MeshGeometry3D%20Normals%20Demystified%20p3_files/Dodecahedron-DiscreteVertices.png">
</p>
<p>
The lights are defined as shown above, and the camera looks straight
down the Z axis. Notice that most of the visible faces are a different
shade because each face is at a different angle to the light source.
The horizontal and vertical scroll bars at the edges of the window let
you scroll it. Faces on the bottom and rear are darker and not distinct
because they're only illuminated by ambient light.
</p>
<p>
In this XAML file, each of the 12 pentagons that make up the dodecahedron are defined with its own set of six <i>Point3D</i> objects — one point for the center of the pentagon and five points for the five vertices. In the file, the <i>Positions</i> collection lists the six <i>Point3D</i> objects for each pentagon on a separate line. There are 12 lines of data for the 12 pentagons and a total of 72 <i>Point3D</i> objects in the <i>Positions</i> collection. Obviously, there are many duplicates points, because a dodecahedron has only 20 vertices total.
</p>
<p>
The <i>TriangleIndices</i> property lists the indices for the 12
pentagons each on a separate line. The first pentagon refers only to
indices of 0 through 5 in the <i>Positions</i> collection; the second
refers to indices of 6 through 11, and so forth. There are a total of
60 triangles in this figure: 5 for each of the 12 pentagon faces. (I am
aware that the dodecahedron can be defined with only three triangles
per face, but I wanted to take a more symmetric approach in this
exercise.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml">Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml</a> file takes a different approach.  The <i>Positions</i>
collection has only 32 points — 12 for the centers of the 12 faces of
the figure, and 20 for the 20 vertices. In the file, the <i>TriangleIndices</i> lists the indices for the six triangles of each pentagon face on a separate line, but vertices are shared among faces. 
</p>
<p>
Not only is the <i>MeshGeometry3D</i> defined quite differently in the second file, but the result is quite different as well:
</p>

</p>
<p>
Were it not for the silhouette, you might think the surface were
rounded like a ball. This is the effect of the default calculation of
normals. If you don't supply a <i>Normals</i> property (which is a collection of <i>Vector3D</i> objects in one-to-one correspondence with the <i>Positions</i>
collection) then normals are calculated for you. At each vertex in the
figure, all the triangles that meet at that vertex are taken into
account. Each of these triangles has a normal vector (which is a vector
perpendicular to the face of the triangle), and an average is taken.
That's the normal used to calculate reflected light at the vertex.
Within each triangle, the amount of reflected light is interpolated
from the normal vectors at the three vertices. In the center of each
pentagon, five triangles meet at one point, but these five triangles
lie in the same plane, so the normal vector at the vertex is the same
as the normal to that plane. At the vertices of each pentagon, however,
three triangles meet at an angle, and the normal vertex is the average
of the three triangle normals.
</p>
<p>This smoothing effect might be highly desirable if you're actually
trying to approximate a curved surface. But if you want to render a
polyhedron with flat faces, it's a total disaster! </p>
<p>
And yet, the instinct of any prudent programmer is to minimize the number of points in the <i>Positions</i>
collection and avoid redundancy. For rendering flat surfaces, it simply
doesn't work that way. You need those duplicates. Don't worry about
performance: My understanding is that the rendering process is
triangle-driven rather than <i>Positions</i> driven; duplicates in the <i>Positions</i> collection have zero effect on performance.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you're trying to render something with curved
surfaces, then the default calculated normals might be sufficient, or
they might not be exactly what you want, in which case you can supply
your own. </p>
<p>
For example, suppose you defined your dodecahedron as in the first
example, and you later decided you wanted all the edges to be smoothed
out. The dodecahedron is centered around the origin, so a little
reflection convinces you that at each vertex, the normal should be
equal to the point of that vertex. Take the
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-DiscreteVertices.xaml">Dodecahedron-DiscreteVertices.xaml</a> file, select the whole <i>Positions</i> attribute, copy it within the <i>MeshGeometry3D</i> element and change the duplicate <i>Positions</i> attribute name to <i>Normals</i>. Now the file displays the same image as 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml">Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml</a>
</p>
<p>
However, there is no <i>Normals</i> property you can add to the 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml">Dodecahedron-SharedVertices.xaml</a>
file to get flat faces.  The <i>Normals</i> collection is in a one-to-one correspondence with the <i>Positions</i> collection, and each vertex in this <i>Positions</i>
collection is shared among three faces, so the area around that vertex
is going to be illuminated the same regardless what you set the normal
to.
</p>
<p>The general rule is this: If you're defining a polyhedron with flat
faces, use a separate set of vertices for each face, and don't forget
to use <i>DirectionalLight</i>.
If you're defining curved surfaces and want smoother transitions
between the faces, by all means share vertices among the faces and let
WPF 3D calculate normals. </p>
<p>
In some cases, you'll want to supply your own <i>Normals</i>
collection if WPF 3D isn't doing what you want. I've been working on a
class that generates mesh geometries for a sphere. I wanted to be able
to generate subsets of the sphere based on ranges of longitude and
latitude. Yet, when I assembled a total sphere from subsets of the
sphere, there were discontinuities at the seams. The problem was that
the default normals at the edges of these parts of the sphere weren't
being calculated correctly. When I supplied an explicit <i>Normals</i> collection based on a vector from the center of the sphere, the seams disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Let me conclude by offering a winter solstice gift — 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/Dodecahedron-Animated.xaml">Dodecahedron-Animated.xaml</a>, which displays a revolving dodecahedron with semi-transparent faces.  Don't make it too large or it'll be a bit jerky.
</p>

Happy holidays!
