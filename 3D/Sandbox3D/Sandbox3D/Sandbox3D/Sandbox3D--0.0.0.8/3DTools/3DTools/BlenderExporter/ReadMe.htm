<h1 align="center">Xaml Exporter Script for Blender</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This script allows Blender to be used as an authoring tool for 3D Windows 
Presentation Foundation (WPF) content.&nbsp; 3D scenes created in Blender are 
exported to .xaml files which can be dynamically loaded or compiled into your 
WPF applications.&nbsp; This script currently works with Blender 2.40.&nbsp; 
Exported Xaml is compatible with the December CTP of the Windows Presentation 
Foundation.&nbsp; For licensing information and to get the latest version go to:

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Ensure you have Blender v2.40 or later installed.&nbsp; You can view 
	your Blender version via the ~Help~About menu.&nbsp; The latest version of 
	Blender can be dowloaded from <a href="http://www.blender.org">
	http://www.blender.org</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Copy the xaml_export.py in the XamlExporter directory to Blender's 
	scripts directory.&nbsp; On Windows this is typically located at one of:<br>
	<br>
	<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">C:\Program Files\Blender 
	Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts<br>
	C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;YourUserName&gt;\Application Data\Blender 
	Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts<br>
	<br>
	</span>depending on the options you chose during installation.&nbsp; There 
	should be similarly named import and export scripts in this directory.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Restart Blender.&nbsp; If the installation was successful &quot;Xaml (.xaml)...&quot; 
	should now appear in Blender's ~File~Export menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Note: The Xaml Exporter script for Blender works with the Python runtime 
included with Blender.&nbsp; A full Python installation is not required.)</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>After composing your 3D scene is Blender choose the ~File~Export~Xaml menu.&nbsp; 
This will display Blender's standard file dialog.&nbsp; Enter the name of your 
scene and press the &quot;Export Xaml&quot; button.</p>
<p>The exported Xaml can be viewed in the WPF Model Viewer (also included in the
<a href="http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/3DTools">3D Tools workspace</a>).&nbsp; 
You can dynamically load the Xaml into your WPF application using 
XamlReader.Load(fileStream).</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The ImageSource property is exported as a fully qualified path as it 
	appears in Blender (e.g., &quot;D:\MyModels\Ballmer.png&quot;).</li>
	<li>The Windows Presentation Foundation does not have an image codec for 
	Targa (*.tga) files.&nbsp; If you export a model which uses Targa files you 
	will need to convert these by hand to a format supported by the WPF (e.g., 
	PNG) and fix the exported .xaml by hand.</li>
	<li>Diffuse materials are exported as a simple texture if applicable or a 
	solid color if no texture is available.&nbsp; Other types of materials are 
	not currently supported.</li>
	<li>Blender uses different lighting equations than the WPF.&nbsp; As a 
	result, exported lighting is approximate.&nbsp; Only &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Lamp&quot;, and 
	&quot;Spot&quot; light types are supported.</li>
	<li>There is currently no support for animation or support for geometry 
	types other than meshes.</li>
</ul>
