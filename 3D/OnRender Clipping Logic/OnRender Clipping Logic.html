In my WPF book, my original Chapter 10 ("Custom Elements") has now
spilled over into Chapter 11 ("Single-Child Elements") and Chapter 12
("Custom Panels") as I continue to wrestle with the art and science of
overriding <i>MeasureOverride</i>, <i>ArrangeOverride</i>, and <i>OnRender</i>.
</p>
<p>
In the past I've noticed that sometimes <i>OnRender</i> seems to
clip and sometimes it does not, and yesterday I tried to finally nail
down a better analysis. My conclusion is simple: Sometimes <i>OnRender</i> clips and sometimes it does not.  Fortunately, I believe I have found the "tipping point" and have some code to demonstrate it.
</p>
<p>
Background: A class that derives from <i>FrameworkElement</i> but which has no visual children will probably override <i>MeasureOverride</i> and <i>OnRender</i>. <i>MeasureOverride</i> has an argument of type <i>Size</i> commonly called <i>availableSize</i> or (in a naming scheme I prefer) <i>sizeAvailable</i>. This is generally the size of the element's container, for example, the client area of a window or the cell of a <i>Grid</i>. If the window has been set for <i>SizeToContent</i> or the <i>Grid</i> cell set for <i>Auto</i>, then one or more dimensions of <i>sizeAvailable</i> could be infinite (that is, the value <i>Double.PositiveInfinity</i>). The <i>sizeAvailable</i> dimensions exclude the <i>Margin</i> set for the element and are always non-negative. (It gets more complex when <i>Width</i>, <i>MinWidth</i>, <i>MaxWidth</i>, <i>Height</i>, <i>MinHeight</i>, or <i>MaxHeight</i> have been set on the element. I'll ignore those cases in this discussion.)
</p>
<p>
The return value of <i>MeasureOverride</i> is also a <i>Size</i> object that I name <i>sizeDesired</i>. It is the duty of the element's override of <i>MeasureOverride</i>
to indicate a proper "natural" size of the element or at least a
minimum size. For example, a button that contains text would return a
size based on the text string, the font, and the button border.
</p>
<p>
The element also overrides <i>OnRender</i>, during which the
element is responsible for drawing itself. The element assumes an
origin of (0, 0) and drawing dimensions given by the <i>RenderSize</i> property. <i>RenderSize</i> is often set directly from the return value from <i>MeasureOverride</i>, but there's an important exception: If the container has a non-infinite width (that is, the parameter to <i>sizeAvailable.Width</i> argument to <i>MeasureOverride</i> was non-infinite), and if the <i>HorizontalAlignment</i> of the element is set to <i>Stretch</i>, then <i>RenderSize.Width</i> will the maximum of <i>sizeAvailable.Width</i> and <i>sizeDesired.Width</i> (the return value from <i>MeasureOverride</i>), and similarly for the height. This is how many elements exhibit a default behavior of filling up their containers.
</p>
<p>
Let's go to the code: <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/RectAndText.cs">RectAndText.cs</a> is a simple no-child <i>FrameworkElement</i> derivative that overrides <i>MeasureOverride</i> and <i>OnRender</i>
to display a text string inside a rectangle. To illustrate clipping, it
also displays 4 lines extending from the rectangle to points beyond the
window.
</p>
<p>
The <i>MeasureOverride</i> method calculates a desired size of the element based on the rectangle border width and the size of the <i>FormattedText</i> object. If the <i>Mode</i> property equals 0 (the default case) that's the size that the element returns from <i>MeasureOverride</i>. As it's supposed to, the <i>OnRender</i> method uses the <i>RenderSize</i> property to size the rectangle, and then displays the <i>FormattedText</i> object inside the rectangle.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/TryRectAndText.cs">TryRectAndText.cs</a> puts this custom element in the fill section of a <i>DockPanel</i> and sets up a menu to change the <i>Mode</i> property. (Here's the  <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/TryRectAndText.csproj">TryRectAndText.csproj</a> project file to round out the project.) Notice that the <i>RectAndText</i> element is given <i>HorizontalAlignment</i> and <i>VerticalAlignment</i> values of <i>Center</i> and a <i>Margin</i> (on all four sides) of 192 device-independent units (two inches). The <i>Margin</i> setting implies that the <i>sizeAvailable</i> parameter to <i>MeasureOverride</i> equals the size of the window client area minus the menu minus 4 inches horizontally and vertically.
</p>
<p>When you first run the program, you should see the entire rectangle
with the text inside and four lines going off in the four directions.
There's no clipping going on. Now gradually make the window narrower.
When you reach the point where there's only two inches on the left and
right, suddenly clipping kicks in. The lines at the left and right
disappear, part of the border on the left and right disappears, and the
lines on the top and bottom become much shorter. The clipping area is
obviously based on <i>sizeAvailable</i> but it only kicks in when <i>sizeDesired</i> becomes greater than <i>sizeAvailable</i>. 
</p>
<p>
As you make the window even narrower, you'll see the left and right
sides of the rectangle disappear. If you've experimented with WPF
buttons, you'll know they behave a little differently if the buttons
are sized too small for their content. The regular button truncates its
content but still attempts to display its border (unless the container
gets way too small).
</p>
<p>
To mimic that behavior, I decided to set the return value from <i>MeasureOverride</i> to values no larger than the parameter to <i>MeasureOverride</i>.  That's <i>Mode</i>
equal to 1, which you can set from the program's menu by selecting
"Constrain MeasureOverride return value from parameter". (Keep in mind
that the parameter to <i>MeasureOverride</i> reflects the container size less the <i>Margin</i> property of the element.) The corresponding code in <i>MeasureOverride</i> is:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>sizeDesired.Width = Math.Min(sizeDesired.Width, sizeAvailable.Width);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
and similarly for the height. And what happens is very bizarre. <i>RenderSize</i> (which is based on the return value from <i>MeasureOverride</i>)
now changes as the window is made too narrow or too short, but there is
no clipping at all going on, so the text that's supposed to be inside
the rectangle now spills out. You probably don't want this happening in
a real-life program, so there are a couple solutions. The first is to
simply set a clipping area for the <i>DrawingContext</i> right in the <i>OnRender</i> method:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>dc.PushClip(new RectangleGeometry(new Rect(new Point(0, 0), RenderSize)));
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
The other solution is illustrated by setting a <i>Mode</i> value
of 2 in my program, available from the menu by selecting "Add 0.1 to
constrained return value." This option adds 0.1 to the value calculated
from Mode 1. The additional code is:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>sizeDesired.Width += 0.1;
</pre>
</ul>
<p>and similarly for the height. And now if you make the window too
narrow or short, clipping kicks in. Now the rectangle behaves more like
the normal WPF button. The rectangle is always displayed and, if
necessary, the contents get truncated.
</p>
<p>
So, if (<i>sizeDesired.Width</i> &lt;= <i>sizeAvailable.Width</i> &amp;&amp; <i>sizeDesired.Height</i> &lt;= <i>sizeAvailable.Height</i>) then there's no clipping. Otherwise, <i>OnRender</i> output is clipped to <i>sizeAvailable</i>.
</p>
<p>Personally, I would prefer that this logic involve &lt; rather than
&lt;= so that fudge factors don't have to be used to make the clipping
kick in those cases when <i>sizeDesired</i> is constrained to <i>sizeAvailable</i> .
