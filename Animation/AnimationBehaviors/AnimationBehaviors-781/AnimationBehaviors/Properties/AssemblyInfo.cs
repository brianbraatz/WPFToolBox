Shared Source Community License (SS-CL)
Published: October 18, 2005

This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,
you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the
software.

1. Definitions

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction" and "distribution" have the same meaning
here as under U.S. copyright law.

"You" means the licensee of the software.

"Larger work" means the combination of the software and any additions or
modifications to the software.

"Licensed patents" means any Licensor patent claims which read directly on the
software as distributed by Licensor under this license.


2. Grant of Rights

(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the
license conditions and limitations in section 3, the Licensor grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce the
software, prepare derivative works of the software and distribute the software
or any derivative works that you create.

(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
conditions and limitations in section 3, the Licensor grants you a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under licensed patents to make, have
made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
software or derivative works of the software.


3. Conditions and Limitations

(A) Reciprocal Grants- Your rights to reproduce and distribute the software (or
any part of the software), or to create and distribute derivative works of the
software, are conditioned on your licensing the software or any larger work you
create under the following terms:

1. If you distribute the larger work as a series of files, you must grant all
recipients the copyright and patent licenses in sections 2(A) & 2(B) for
any file that contains code from the software. You must also provide
recipients the source code to any such files that contain code from the
software along with a copy of this license. Any other files which are
entirely your own work and which do not contain any code from the software
may be licensed under any terms you choose.

2. If you distribute the larger work as a single file, then you must grant
all recipients the rights set out in sections 2(A) & 2(B) for the entire
larger work. You must also provide recipients the source code to the
larger work along with a copy of this license.

(B) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you any rights to use the 
Licensor’s name, logo, or trademarks.

(C) If you distribute the software in source code form you may do so only under
this license (i.e., you must include a complete copy of this license with your
distribution), and if you distribute the software solely in compiled or object
code form you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.

(D) If you begin patent litigation against the Licensor over patents that you
think may apply to the software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), your license to the software ends automatically.

(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The Licensor
gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional
consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the
extent permitted under your local laws, the Licensor excludes the implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.
