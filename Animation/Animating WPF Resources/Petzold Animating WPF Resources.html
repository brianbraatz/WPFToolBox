In most common WPF and XAML applications, you don't often find yourself
needing to animate a resource. Generally you define resources (such as
brushes) so that you can share them among multiple elements in the XAML
file, and it's not often necessary to animate something that's shared
in this way. Moreover, if you really wanted to animate the shared
brush, you could do so indirectly through one of the elements that use
that brush.
</p>
<p>However, there are cases where you need to define an object as a
resource not because you need to share that object, but because you
can't put that object directly in the markup. The resource is then
referenced by an element in markup through a data binding. If you then
need to animate that resource, some special considerations come into
play.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose you wanted to create a graphical animation of a <i>Polyline</i> that looks something like this:
</p>

</p>
<p>
The actual pattern isn't important: What's probably obvious is that a bunch of points in a <i>PointCollection</i> are being generated algorithmically, and the <i>Polyline</i>
is redrawing itself based on those changing points. It's possible for a
class generating these points to do so in response to a <i>DispatcherTimer</i> or <i>VisualTarget</i> event. But it's probably best to have the whole point-generation process controlled by the WPF animation system. 
</p>
<p>
The algorithm to generate the <i>PointCollection</i> is implemented in a class named <i>Curler</i>. <i>Curler</i> has a property named <i>Angle</i> that indicates the degree that the points are curled. Of course, it would be most convenient to derive <i>Curler</i> from <i>PointCollection</i> and put <i>Curler</i> directly in a <i>Polyline</i> element in XAML using a <i>Polyline.Points</i> property element.
</p>
<p>
The problem with that brilliant idea is that <i>PointCollection</i> is sealed. You cannot derive from it. Instead, you need to give <i>Curler</i> a get-only property of type <i>Points</i> of type <i>PointCollection</i> and include <i>Curler</i> in your XAML file as a resource.  You can define a resource of type <i>Curler</i> like this (assuming the XML namespace "src" has been set to the namespace and perhaps assembly containing the <i>Curler</i> class):
</p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller;">
&lt;src:Curler x:Key="curler" ... /&gt;
</ul>
<p>
You can then reference that resource in a <i>Polyline</i> element like so:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller;">
&lt;Polyline ... Points="{Binding Source={StaticResource curler},<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Path=Points}"
/&gt;
</ul>
<p>
That's probably sufficient if <i>Curler</i> animates itself using <i>DispatcherTimer</i> or <i>VisualTarget</i>. But you probably want to use WPF animation with <i>Curler</i>. I mentioned that <i>Curler</i> has a property named <i>Angle</i> that governs the amount of curl, so that's the property that you'll be animating, and the property you'll reference by the <i>Storyboard.TargetProperty</i> attached property. But you also need to set the <i>Storyboard.TargetName</i> attached property, and therein lies a problem: The <i>Curler</i> resource needs an <i>x:Name</i> attribute, and you can define an <i>x:Name</i> for <i>Curler</i> but it won't be found, and, indeed, the documentation of <i>x:Name</i> essentially says that it'll be ignored:
</p>
<ul>x:Name cannot be applied in certain scopes. For instance, items in
a ResourceDictionary cannot have names, because they already have the
x:Key Attribute as their unique identifier.
</ul>
<p>
Can you instead use the <i>x:Key</i> name itself for the <i>Storyboard.TargetName</i> property? No, you cannot. So what do you do?
</p>
<p>
This problem drove me nuts until I realized the not-so-obvious solution: Define a <i>Name</i> property in the <i>Curler</i> class. You can actually give this property any name you want, but you have to indicate that name in an attribute for the <i>Curler</i> class:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller;">
[RuntimeNameProperty("Name")]
</ul>
<p>
You'll also need a <i>using</i> directive for <i>System.Windows.Markup</i> or precede <i>RuntimeNameProperty</i> with that namespace. 
</p>
<p>
In the XAML resource, you can use the same name for <i>x:Key</i> and <i>Name</i>,
and if you get a compiler error that says "Because 'Curler" is
implemented in the same assembly, you must set the x:Name attribute
rather than the Name attribute," that's OK. Just use <i>x:Name</i> in the resource and it'll work:
</p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace; font-size: smaller;">
&lt;src:Curler x:Key="curler"  x:Name="curler"  /&gt;
</ul>
<p>
If <i>Curler</i> has an property named <i>Angle</i> that you want to animate, <i>Angle</i> must be backed by a dependency property and at the very least, <i>Curler</i> must derive from <i>DependencyObject</i>. For the binding between the <i>Points</i> property of <i>Curler</i> and the <i>Points</i> property of <i>Polyline</i>, you'll also want to back <i>Points</i> with a dependency property, and set <i>Points</i> from the <i>PropertyChangedCallback</i> method for <i>Angle</i>.  (Don't worry: Downloadable source code is coming up.) The CLR property for <i>Points</i> can have a public <i>get</i> accessor and a protected or private <i>set</i> accessor so the <i>Points</i> property can't be set from outside the class.
</p>
<p>
The structure of the <i>Angle</i> and <i>Points</i> properties in the <i>Curler</i>
class is characteristic of classes that have animatable properties, and
it's vital to get the hang of it, and to understand how it's different
from code you might write for WinForms. In a WinForms program, if you
have one property (<i>Angle</i>) whose value affects a get-only property (<i>Points</i>), the set-accessor of the <i>Angle</i> property would respond to changes in the <i>Angle</i> value by firing a notification event named <i>PointsChanged</i>. Anybody using the class would then access the <i>Points</i> property to obtain the new value, and the <i>Points</i>
get-accessor would perform the calculation. This is a type of "pull"
architecture. WPF implements a "push" architecture: When the <i>Angle</i> property changes (which the <i>Curler</i> class is aware of through the <i>PropertyChangedCallback</i> method set through the <i>PropertyMetadata</i> of the <i>Angle</i> dependency property), the <i>Curler</i> class sets the resultant <i>Points</i> property at that time. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>PropertyChangedCallback</i> method that sets the <i>Points</i> property when the <i>Angle</i> property changes will be frequently called when the <i>Angle</i>
property is animated, which means it shouldn't make any memory
allocations, which means that all objects that it needs should be
created in advance as fields. (Realistically speaking, the method can
certainly make a <i>few</i> memory allocations when the animation is
starting up, such as those involved with allocating sufficient space
for something like a <i>PointCollection</i> but it definitely must not
automatically allocate something on each call; the last thing you want
is for the CLR garbage collector to interfere with your animations.)
It's also best when animating the items in a freezable collection (like
<i>PointCollection</i>) to avoid notifications with each new object added in a <i>for</i> loop. For this reason, the method in <i>Curler</i> that fills the <i>PointCollection</i> begins by getting a reference to the collection from <i>Points</i> and then sets the <i>Points</i> property to <i>null</i> so the collection can be filled in peace.  When the collection is ready, then it's set to the <i>Points</i> property.
</p>
<p>
If all the properties in a class such as <i>Curler</i> are dependency properties (remember to back <i>Name</i> with a dependency property as well!) then you can derive the class from <i>Animatable</i>.  Because <i>Animatable</i> inherits from <i>Freezable</i> you need to override the <i>CreateInstanceCore</i>
method and just call the class's constructor and return the value. If
you have properties that aren't packed by dependency properties, then
deriving from <i>Freezable</i> is much more difficult than just providing <i>CreateInstanceCore</i>.  
</p>
<p>
Deriving <i>Curler</i> from <i>Animatable</i> gives the class <i>ApplyAnimationClock</i> and <i>BeginAnimation</i> methods which make the class usable from code in a non-storyboard animation.
