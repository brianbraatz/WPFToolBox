			<p>In one of my <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/net/readingXML_pg3.htm" target="_blank"><u>earlier .NET tutorials</u></a>,
I cover how to read an XML file sequentially and parse the information
as you reach it. While that approach works, for many situations where
you face an XML file whose structure is consistent, better approaches
exist.&nbsp;One such approach, which I will cover in this blog post,
involves loading the XML data directly into memory and picking out
important pieces of data directly using XmlDocument, XmlNode, and
XmlElement.</p>
<p><strong>Our XML Data</strong><br>The XML data I will be using is stored here: <a title="http://www.kirupa.com/net/files/sampleXML.xml" href="http://www.kirupa.com/net/files/sampleXML.xml"><u>http://www.kirupa.com/net/files/sampleXML.xml</u></a>&nbsp;An image emphasizing the data's structure can be seen&nbsp;below:</p>

<p>We have a root Books node with four Book child nodes. Each Book
child node contains an ISBN attribute, and contains two sub-child nodes
called title and author. To read the above data, you can place the
following code inside your Main method, and print out all of the
relevant information:</p>

<p>The above code is fairly straightforward. I load my XML document by
passing in the URL of my XML file, and I store a list of all nodes that
begin with the tag Book in <em>bookList</em>. Once I have this list, I enumerate through <em>bookList</em>
and process the children and attribute information. The details are not
important at this time, for I will provide plently of that in a
tutorial that covers this exact issue. What I want focus on next is the
differences in the code itself that make this approach easier on the
eyes and the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Code Readability is Important</strong><br>Contrast the above snippet of code with the code presented&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kirupa.com/net/readingXML_pg2.htm" target="_blank"><u>simplified approach</u></a>&nbsp;(pasted below):</p>

<p>When looking at both code pieces, there is a major difference in the
level of information you can see without actually running both code
pieces in a program. From my view, the Node/Element approach presented
earlier makes more sense than the above approach involving the
XmlTextReader. My justification for that view is that you can see
clearly what I am trying to do. You can mentally recreate both the
input and hazard a guess as to what&nbsp;the output is, whereas in the
XmlTextReader snippet, it is very difficult to know what is going on
without actually inputting a sample XML file. Having clearly written
code that by itself explains what it does is often called
self-documented code.</p>
<p>Focusing on style and syntax may seem trivial, but it is important
because there will be times when somebody else (or even you!) will be
working with&nbsp;that piece of code.&nbsp;A challenge I face with some
of my real-world projects&nbsp;is how to make sense of code that others
have written. Reading comments help, but working on code that is
-&nbsp;in may ways - self-documenting, helps greatly also.</p>

			<p>It turns out the installer hobbits are not pleased with me, for I ran into <a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=85"><u>another</u></a> temporary installation hitch.&nbsp;When attempting to install the new <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Visual Studio Orcas Beta 1</u></a>&nbsp;preview, I received the following error screen after the installer started:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/OrcasInstall6.png" border="1" height="271" width="364"> </p>
<p>More specifically, the full text of the error message from the log files&nbsp;was the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>[05/02/07,02:31:41] Microsoft .NET Framework v3.5 (x64): [2] <font color="#ff0000">Error code 87</font> for this component means "The parameter is incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, I will outline the various approaches you can take to
fix this issue. If one approach does not work,&nbsp;there is still
hope, for one of the other approaches might work! Let's look at my
first approach.</p>
<p><strong>1. Move Installer Files to a Directory Path with No Spaces</strong><br>I
scanned the MSDN forums for others who had similar issues, and many
were able to resolve this error by moving the Orcas setup files to a
directory whose path did not contain any spaces. For example, <font color="#0080ff">C:\Orcas\Beta\</font>&nbsp;would have worked whereas what I originally had, <font color="#0080ff">C:\Install\Orcas Beta 1\</font> would not have worked because of the spaces in "Orcas Beta 1".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the above approach did not work on either my two test machines.</p>
<p><strong>2. Install .NET Framework 3.5 Beta&nbsp;Separately<br></strong>The
installation seems to fail only when&nbsp;installing the .NET Framework
3.5 Beta.&nbsp;On one of my machines, separately installing the .NET
Framework 3.5 Beta separately&nbsp;prior to running the Orcas setup
worked. You can download the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E3715E6F-E123-428B-8A0F-028AFB9E0322&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank"><u>clicking here</u></a>.</p>
<p>While one of my computers was able to install Orcas using the above
approach, one of my computers gave me the same error code. Time for
Step 3.</p>
<p><strong>3. Run the Orcas .NET Framework Install Separately</strong><br>If you navigate to your Orcas installation folder, find the .NET 3.5 Beta&nbsp;installers and run the installer separately. </p>
<p>For X86, you can find the installer at:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="#0080ff">[Orcas Install Folder]\WCU\dotNetFramework\dotNetFX35\x86</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For X64, you can find the 64-bit version of the&nbsp;installer at:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="#0080ff">[Orcas Install Folder]\WCU\dotNetFramework\dotNetFX35\x64</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason installing the .NET Framework from this location
fixed the problem on my remaining computer, and I was able to get up
and running with the new Orcas beta.</p>
<p>Hope this helped you save some debugging time.</p>

interesting information for developers and designers. The one I was
most interested in was the updates to Silverlight such as the inclusion
of a&nbsp;cross-platform&nbsp;version of the&nbsp;.NET CLR. This means
that developers do not have to just&nbsp;use JavaScript to code
their&nbsp;Silverlight content, but they can use languages such as C#,
VB.net, Python, etc.</p>
<p>To learn more about the CLR support in Silverlight, take a look at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=304508"><u>Scott Guthrie's 36 minute Channel 9 Video</u></a> outlining some of the technical details. The main reason why adding support for .NET matters, like I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=86" target="_blank"><u>my earlier post</u></a>,
is that millions of .NET developers will attempt to port their existing
familiarity in the .NET languages towards targeting Silverlight. Beyond
just that, you gain the ability to take full advantage of Visual Studio
to handle the coding, and, like before, you still have access to the
nifty Expression Studio programs for creating the user interface. Let's
look at the integration between those two software suites and their
role with designers and developers in greater detail.</p>
<p><strong>It's Actually about the Designers, Developers, and the Tools</strong><br>Having
the right tools can greatly improve&nbsp;your final product&nbsp;and
even speed up development by making complicated/repetitive/unnecessary
tasks easier.&nbsp;Extremely talented individuals can create great
applications <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_problems_solved_by_MacGyver" target="_blank"><u>MacGuyver</u></a>-style with a rock and some shoestring. For the rest of us, there is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Visual Studio</u></a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/" target="_blank"><u>Expression Studio</u></a>.</p>
<p>At the keynote, Scott Guthrie and Wayne Smith gave hands-on demos
where they created or extended small applications using Visual Studio
as well as products from Expression Studio such as Design and Blend.
The integration between these products is what makes, at least in my
view, life easier for both designers and developers.</p>
<p>The following diagram provides a brief overview of how I view
application development and where these current products from Microsoft
fall into:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/diagram.png" height="480" width="454"> </p>
<p>When creating any type of web or client based content, you often
have two roles of creators - designers and developers. The designers
are responsible for how the product looks, and the developers are
responsible for how the product works. In many real-life situations,
unless one person is both the designer and developer, what the designer
expected and what the developer coded are often different things.</p>
<p>The XAML format really acts as a bridge between the designer and
developer camps. Everything that constitutes a user-interface can be
defined in a XAML file, and the XAML file can be independently worked
on by a designer using Notepad or any of the Expression Studio tools.
The developer can independently write, test, and debug the applicaton's
logic using Visual Studio. When it comes time to actually deploy the
application, the XAML file the designer worked on is molded to the code
files the developer worked on to create your final application. Nothing
gets lost in translation. What the designer worked on is what is
visible on the screen, and what the developer worked on powers the
functionality of the application. Everyone is happy!</p>
<p><strong>Demos and More Coverage</strong><br>If you are looking for demos, there are a some (with more planned) on the <a href="http://www.visitmix.com/" target="_blank"><u>VisitMix.com</u></a> site, and I've provided links to those I saw demo'ed at the keynote below:</p>

			<h3>April 27th, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=88#comments" class="commentslink" title="Comment on Flash CS3’s Publishing to HTML Changes">1 Comment</a></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>One
of the less publicized changes in Flash CS3 has been the improvements
made when publishing your content to HTML. By default, in Flash 8 and
earlier, when you specify HTML as a publishing option, two files would
be generated - your HTML and SWF files. While the HTML file contained
the tags required to play your SWF and worked well
out-of-the-box,&nbsp;it had some unresolved issues. The main issue for
developers revolved around avoding the dreaded "Click here to activate
and use this control" message that affected Internet Explorer users:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/activate_ss.jpg" border="1" height="106" width="260"></p>
<p>To remedy that problem, you often had to&nbsp;use solutions such as <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/flash8/flash_fix.htm" target="_blank"><u>my article</u></a>&nbsp;where you use a third party JavaScript file such as <a href="http://blog.deconcept.com/2006/04/24/swfobject-nee-flashobject-1-4-released/" target="_blank"><u>FlashObject</u></a>&nbsp;to
handle embedding the Flash content. Beyond specifying the parameters to
your JavaScript file, you needed to specify a div section in your HTML
where the Flash content would actually be loaded. While
these&nbsp;steps were not time consuming, they still&nbsp;added a few
extra roadblocks between&nbsp;you and providing your users with a
consistent experience.</p>
<p><strong>Flash CS3's Changes - Embed and Standards</strong><br>In
Flash CS3, though, a lot of the extra steps needed to publish your
content in earlier versions&nbsp;can be avoided. By default, the embed
issue is fixed after a&nbsp;publish operation.&nbsp;Unlike the two
files generated by Flash versions earlier than 8, the new publish
option in&nbsp;Flash CS3 generates three files - the usual HTML and SWF
files, but also a JavaScript file:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/blog_files.png" border="1" height="135" width="286"> </p>
<p>The JavaScript file fixes the embed issue, and the HTML produced
relies exclusively on the JavaScript to display the Flash content. Rest
assured that the classic embed/param approach still exists inside
&lt;noscript&gt; tags where users who have JavaScript disabled in their
browser can still view your content.</p>
<p>While I focused primarily on the embed issue, Flash CS3's
HTML&nbsp;output seems more standards compliant also. Over the years,
various 3rd party implementations have been provided to improve the
HTML output, and the most common one I noticed was the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flashsatay/" target="_blank"><u>Flash Satay</u></a>
approach. With CS3, most browsers will see a cleaner version of the
code used to display Flash content, but&nbsp;the caveat is that the
embed/object/param tags have not disappeareed entirely. If your users
do not have JavaScript enabled, the browser will read the information
from, what I mentioned earlier,&nbsp;the &lt;noscript&gt; tags which
do&nbsp;contain embed/object/param.</p>

			<h3>April 24th, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=87#comments" class="commentslink" title="Comment on Implementing Save and Restore (MVC, Consistency, etc.)">1 Comment</a></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>For
several research&nbsp;projects I am currently working on, the user
saves their work to the disk when exiting the program. Unlike my
earlier Notepad clone, the data that is saved&nbsp;or later
opened&nbsp;is more complex than simply writing and reading&nbsp;a
simple&nbsp;string of data to a text field. The saved file contains
data that really modifies how the application behaves.</p>
<p>Let's say&nbsp;you have an application that allows you to specify
the coordinates of a map, add your own points of interest to
it,&nbsp;and save what you've created to a data&nbsp;file:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/mapexample.jpg" height="205" width="371"> </p>
<p>When the you launch the same application and open you save
file,&nbsp;you would probably&nbsp;like the application to retrieve the
map based on the saved coordinates and display the points of
interest&nbsp;you added. In other words, you would expect that opening
your save file would allow you to pick up from where you left off and
continue without having to spend time redo-ing what you did earlier.</p>
<p>Often times, functionality to save and restore an application's
state is taken for granted. Actually implementing save and restore
functionality requires a certain level of planning before a lot of code
is actually written. There are numerous ways to implement save and
restore, but one approach I use is to make the&nbsp;design more
modular. Let's look at what modular design really entails.</p>
<p><strong>Modular Design</strong><br>A modular design allows you to
divide major chunks of your application into smaller, more maintainable
portions. A common modular design idiom is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"><u>Model View Controller (MVC)</u></a>
design pattern. With an MVC approach, your application is approximately
divided into three components - your data (Model), the UI (View), and
input (Controller). As an aside, many modern programming languages and
tools enforce MVC out of the box!</p>
<p>While you have three components in MVC, they are interdependent and
require constant communication between each other. This is done to
ensure that changes on one end are propagated throughout&nbsp;your
application like you would want.&nbsp;For example, if your Model were
to be updated, your view would automatically adjust to react to the
model's new change. Let's focus on the model for a bit, for it
is&nbsp;important when tackling our original problem. When saving and
restoring an application's state, your Model would need&nbsp;store all
of the information from the save file. In a well designed
system,&nbsp;your View would update itself after being signaled by the
Model, draw the maps, and place the pushpins based on the data stored
in the Model.</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Consistent Entry Point</strong><br>Beyond knowing
how implement a modular design, there are various implementation
details that go into play here. One detail&nbsp;that I like to focus in
my applications is a simple, consistent&nbsp;entry point for updating
the model easily.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to be in a position where all of your View
modifications can be made by using the following functions to update
your Model:</p>
<blockquote><p>LoadMapFromCoordinates(....);<br>RegisterPin(5, "Red", Coordinate(....));<br>RegisterPin(2, "Blue",.....);<br>RegisterPin(1, "Blue",.....)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is nice about the above approach is that you can not only use
the above functions for reading saved data from your file, you can also
use the same functions when processing user actions within your
applications. Essentially, you are reusing the same function for
multiple purposes, and that is a good thing.&nbsp;Besides the obvious
reasons such as code maintainability, this is a good thing because
regardless of how the data gets to your model, via a save file or via
user input, the end state of your application will be the same. Or at
least it should be!</p>
<p>The main takeway from this post is that having a good save and
restore functionality requires some planning. Second, the guts of your
application can be ridiculously complicated, but&nbsp;access to them,
though, should be kept as simple and consistent as possible.</p>

			<p>Whenever
a new product is released to compete with an existing market leader,
the x-killer scenario is quickly thrown around. The x-killer scenario
occurs when a newly introduced&nbsp;product is paraded by 3rd parties
as something created to kill&nbsp;an existing product.&nbsp;To be more
specific,&nbsp;in this case, the new product is Microsoft's
Silverlight, and the existing product is Adobe's Flash-based
technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Silverlight - the Flash Killer?</strong><br>At the <a href="http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home" target="_blank"><u>NAB</u></a>&nbsp;conference a few days ago,&nbsp;Microsoft announced and released a pre-release version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" target="_blank"><u>Silverlight</u></a>&nbsp;(formerly
known as WPF/e). In its current state, Silverlight is a
Windows/Mac&nbsp;browser plug-in that allows developers to write
interactive applications such as media players, games, etc.&nbsp;using
JavaScript and a subset of the functionality found&nbsp;in Windows
Presentation Foundation (WPF).</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a great new technology, has a cool logo,
and&nbsp;it features a&nbsp;catchy name (from MS nonetheless!)
Underneath&nbsp;this though, it&nbsp;is supposedly dangerous.&nbsp;If
you do a quick news search using the keywords"<a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=silverlight+flash+killer" target="_blank"><u><strong>silverlight flash killer</strong></u></a>",
you are going to see a long list of articles from various publications
that&nbsp;attribute Silverlight as a "flash killer" in the title or in
the body of the text:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/searchresults.gif" border="1" height="254" width="540"> </p>
<p>This notion isn't just secluded to news publications. A quick search on blog search engine&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/%22flash+killer%22?language=n&amp;authority=a7" target="_blank"><u>Technorati</u></a> turns up similar results&nbsp;(search filter set to high-authority to remove noise). Last, but not least, even a <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=257598" target="_blank"><u>kForum thread</u></a> concerning Silverlight's threat to Flash&nbsp;didn't escape the clutches of the x-killer people.</p>
<p><strong>One + One != Zero</strong><br>When you have&nbsp;invested a
lot of resources towards using a particular technology, any perceived
threat to it can put you on the defensive. Such a threat can make an
x-killer case sound appealing, but&nbsp;one thing to keep in mind,
though,&nbsp;is that&nbsp;a new product being introduced does not
signal the end of all products that compete&nbsp;or coexist
with&nbsp;it. The world of developer&nbsp;languages is not&nbsp;a
zero-sum game where x-killers&nbsp;end up being&nbsp;proven true all
the time. Silverlight is as much of a Flash-killer as Flash was in
killing off animated GIFs, JavaScript, and HTML.&nbsp;The Flash Player
has had a good ten years of air-time to do&nbsp;so also! Instead, all
of these technologies coexist even though a lot of the functionality
seems to overlap. That is because no one technology is right for all
tasks. The introduction of a new product should be seen as a good thing
because somebody out there values your preferred playground (the web,
the desktop, etc.) as something worth investing in.</p>
<p>If anything, the introduction of Silverlight makes the world of
internet applications more accessible to a larger group of developers.
At its core, Silverlight is just a natural extension of a subset of the
new WPF/XAML language you might use for your desktop application. This
similarity&nbsp;allows a lot of Windows developers, who are familiar
(or will be soon!)&nbsp;with WPF and the development tools for using
them such as Visual Studio or Expression Blend, to try their hand at
creating applications that run in the browser.</p>
<p>Any successful&nbsp;technology such as Flash that&nbsp;has been
around for a while has&nbsp;a whole ecosystem around it where the
environment sustains the product just as much as the product itself.
Almost all developer technologies fit this category. You probably don't
see C++, C, etc.&nbsp;getting front page coverage on websites and
publications, but they are still as relevant today as they were decades
earlier even if newer technologies and platforms seem to be getting
more attention.</p>
<p>Current developers are not suddenly going to switch sides to either
Adobe or MS&nbsp;because of Silverlight, WPF, Flex, Apollo, Flash CS3,
etc. If anything,&nbsp;you'll get some cross-pollination where
developers are familiar enough with both companies' offerings to use
the right tool for the right job. Beyond cross-pollination, what
excites me most about these technologies is that you now open the
playing field to many more developers who now feel more comfortable
porting their existing knowledge developing client-side applications
towards the browser.</p>
<p>In the end, the key is to look beyond your own preferences and
look&nbsp;at the broader picture as a whole. As a designer/developer,
your primary&nbsp;goal should be to create the best software for your
users, and the new wave of products from both&nbsp;Adobe and Microsoft
make that job a lot easier.</p>

		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>When installing Adobe&nbsp;CS3 on Vista, you might run into an&nbsp;<strong>Internal Error 2739</strong>&nbsp;that prevents your setup from proceeding. Adobe is currently addressing this issue <a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb401521&amp;sliceId=1" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>,
and they have working instructions for the 64-bit version of Vista, but
it looks like they are still working on updating the instructions for
the 32-bit version:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/cs3steps.gif" border="1" height="157" width="527"></p>
<p>If you are running Vista 32, in this post I will briefly address the
missing steps needed between steps 2 and 3 to get CS3 installed. Like
the tagline on their support site says, this error is caused by a
registration issue with the <em>jscript.dll</em> file.</p>
<p>To register your DLL file, click on your Start orb. Type in the words <strong>cmd</strong>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/cs3_start.png" border="1" height="149" width="266"></p>
<p>After you typed cmd, you should see the <strong>cmd</strong> (Command Prompt) icon appear as your search result. Right click on that result and select "Run as Administrator":</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/cs3_run_as_admin.jpg" border="1" height="155" width="424"></p>
<p>Your command prompt running with administrator privileges will now appear. From this prompt, type the following and press Enter:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>regsvr32 jscript.dll</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After you type the above and press Enter, you will receive a
confirmation dialog box informing you that the registration was
successful:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/cs3_regsvr.png" border="0" height="170" width="405"></p>
<p>That's all there is to it. Now, you can go back to run your
installer again. This time everything should work, and you'll be
presented with the spiffy new installer - well, new if you only used
Macromedia's products and were more familiar with their less spiffy
installers:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/newInstaller.jpg" border="1" height="289" width="506"></p>
<p>If you are running the 64-bit version of Vista, be sure to follow the full instructions from the <a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb401521&amp;sliceId=1" target="_blank"><u>Adobe Technote link</u></a>, for the instructions for registering the dll are not the same as what I presented in this post.</p>
<p>Future Flash-related articles on the site will focus primarily on
Flash CS3/ActionScript 3.0, and I have a few .NET and Blend specific
tutorials in the pipeline also.</p>

			<h3>April 17th, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=84#comments" class="commentslink" title="Comment on AttachMovie, Auxiliary Data, and Dynamic Languages">4 Comments</a></h3>
		</div>
		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>In
my earlier post, I discussed using the Tag element to store auxiliary
data to a WPF control. You have similar functionality in ActionScript's
attachMovie function (and others!), and in this post I will explain
some of the interesting things about this and what allows it to work
the way it does.</p>
<p><strong>Hello AttachMovie</strong><br>The attachMovie function is
used to take content during runtime&nbsp;from your library and display
it on your stage. For an in-depth look at attachmovie, the <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/flash8/animateDynamicMC.htm" target="_blank"><u>Animating Dynamic MovieClips</u></a>
tutorial&nbsp;will come in handy.&nbsp;AttachMovie, though, does more
than just simply displaying library elements on your stage. One
interesting feature&nbsp;concerns&nbsp;the arguments attachMovie
takes.&nbsp;Among its strictly defined arguments are <em>idName</em>, <em>newName</em>, and <em>depth</em>, but attachMovie also&nbsp;takes an arbitrary amount of loosely defined arguments denoted as <em>initObject</em>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/attachMovie.png" border="1" height="101" width="536"> </p>
<p>What the initObject allows you to do is pass in data the newly attached movieclip will have within its <a href="http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-advanced=1&amp;sp-q=scope&amp;B1=search&amp;sp-a=00040c2f-sp00000000&amp;sp-w-control=1;" target="_blank"><u>scope</u></a>.
The data can be mapped to variables such&nbsp;as the properties _x,
_alpha, etc., but the data can also be random variables that the
attached movie stores within itself.</p>
<p>For example, let's look at the following code snippet of a attachMovie function:</p>
<p>
</p><dl class="kASHglobal">
<dt><span class="kASHidn">this</span>.<span class="kASHidn">attachMovie</span><span class="kASHop">(</span><span class="kASHqt">"circleMC"</span>,
</dt><dt><span class="kASHqt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "newCircle"</span>,
</dt><dt><span class="kASHidn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this</span>.<span class="kASHwrd">getNextHighestDepth</span><span class="kASHop">()</span>,
</dt><dt><span class="kASHop">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</span><span class="kASHidn">_x</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHnum">40</span>, <span class="kASHidn">_y</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHnum">50</span>, <span class="kASHidn">_alpha</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHnum">75</span>, <span class="kASHwrd">kName</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHqt">"Kirupa"</span>, k<span class="kASHwrd">Color</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHqt">"Blue"</span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="kASHwrd">kAge</span><span class="kASHop">:</span><span class="kASHnum">22</span><span class="kASHop">})</span>; </dt>
</dl>
<p>The main thing to notice in the above snippet of code is the last
two lines where the initObject arguments are passed in. The _x, _y, and
_alpha properties ensure that the attached movie clip is positioned at
40, 50 with an alpha of 75. More interestingly, the attached movie also
stores within its scope the variables <em>kName</em>, <em>kColor</em>, and <em>kAge</em>
and their respective values. These variables and their data can be
easily accessed by code contained inside the attached movie clip!</p>
<p>What confuses many is this whole idea of having variables stored and
passed into some cloud and accessed later. After all, there really is
no easy way to know which values have been passed in to your attached
movieclip unless you look carefully at the code or add trace statements
to your movie clip itself.</p>
<p>To explain it a little better, let's look at the following image:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/worldView.png" height="272" width="429"> </p>
<p>In the above image, you have your newly attached&nbsp;movie
clip&nbsp;called newCircle&nbsp;storing the variables you passed into
it. One thing to note is that these variables are localized to this
instance of the newCircle&nbsp;movie clip. If you were to add more
newCircle movie clips, they too would contain copies of the kName,
kColor, and kAge values. This is almost&nbsp;like what you see with
constructors in a strictly OOP language that creates&nbsp;new
objects&nbsp;that inherit&nbsp;certain values.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Languages Giveth and they Taketh</strong><br>So, in
the end, attachMovie and other similar functions provide a great level
of flexibility when it comes to adding your own data to them. This
flexibilty comes with the cost of increased time debugging when things
don't work as you expected. For example, for your attachMovie
function's initObject argument, if&nbsp;you accidentally spelled
kColor:"Foo" as kColour:"Foo", your attached movie clip will not inform
you of the misspelled kColour variable or&nbsp;point out
a&nbsp;reference to a non-existant kColor variable in your attached
movie clip. For all it knows, Flash will assume that you meant to
create a new variable called kColour instead, and kColor will be
populated later using some approach like _root.newCircle.kColor =
"Green". It is extremely difficult to guess what your intentions were,
so Flash correctly doesn't attempt to interfere.</p>
<p>The above advantages and disadvantages are part of the dynamic,
non-strict nature of the ActionScript language. Contrasting this you
have more strict languages such as the C and Java languages&nbsp;where
you cannot use a variable without declaring it, and almost always,
declaring a type to go with the variable. The stricter approach makes
testing your applications easier, but you lose the flexibilty that you
enjoy with a dynamic language. There are good and bad points to both
language types, and you'll see ActionScript 2.0 and 3.0 incorporate
some nice features from the more strict languages, and you see good
dynamic language support in, for example,&nbsp;the .NET CLR with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython" target="_blank"><u>IronPython</u></a>, <a href="http://www.rubyclr.com/"><u>RubyCLR</u></a>, and others.</p>
<p><strong>WPF Equivalent to initObject</strong><br>If you are using
C#, you can almost emulate the above functionality. The Tag element, as
mentioned in my earlier post, takes in an argument of type object,
which is great because you can pass in a value of any type to it. The
downside is that the Tag element stores only one such object. You can't
pass in a sequence of object variables like you are able to in
attachMovie.</p>
<p>To simulate such functionality, you would need to use something like&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=42" target="_blank"><u>Structs</u></a>
where you create your own datatype that takes in as many arguments as
you want. Your&nbsp;Tag element would be set equal to your Structs
which, in turn, store all of these&nbsp;values that you want.
Consequently,&nbsp;a less efficient solution would be to pass in all of
your arguments to a List and pass that List to your Tag element.</p>

		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>One
of the difficulties of graphically representing data using WPF (Windows
Presentation Foundation)&nbsp;controls&nbsp;is&nbsp;that it can be
tricky to retrieve that data at a later stage.&nbsp;This isn't a
problem when you are using controls such as a button where its function
doesn't really change depending on what the program is actually doing.</p>
<p>When you get UI controls representing data that can change,
though,&nbsp;then it becomes more important to have the control store
auxiliary information about the data. One example where auxiliary data
is useful is when you are showing folder and file data from a remote
web server using TreeViews:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/treeViewItemView.png" border="1" height="222" width="495"> </p>
<p>In the above example, I am building my TreeView incrementally.
Depending on the TreeViewItem I click, the program will either do
nothing or expand that TreeViewItem to display the subfolders and
files. In such a situation, it would be helpful if I stored information
on whether what I am clicking on&nbsp;is a folder or a&nbsp;file. It
would be even more helpful, if the TreeViewItem I am clicking on stored
that information itself.</p>
<p><strong>The Tag Element</strong><br>To store auxiliary data on your control like we want, you can use your control's Tag element:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/tagSS.gif" border="1" height="242" width="411"> </p>
<p>What makes the Tag element&nbsp;useful is that it&nbsp;allows you to store data of type <em>object</em>.&nbsp;In programming terms, having something that stores values&nbsp;as <em>object</em>
is the equivalent of being handed a signed blank check. You can do
pretty much anything! This type of flexibility is essential because you
won't know what kind of auxiliary data you will be storing. For
example, you may be storing a string of names in one application, or
you may be storing a custom folder type in another application.</p>
<p>To retrieve your data stored in the Tag format, you cannot simply
set a variable equal to that of your Tag object unless your variable is
of type <em>object</em> also. You will&nbsp;need to typecast the data from the generic object to the more specific type that you want your data in:</p>
<p><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/tagCode.gif" height="97" width="409"> </p>
<p>In the above example, if you look at the second line, I am
retrieving a TreeViewItem that I stored in a MenuItem. In order to
access it, I call selected.Tag and then use the "as Type" syntax to go
from object to TreeViewItem as in&nbsp;<em>selected.Tag as TreeViewItem</em>.
In the commented out line, you'll see the more traditional syntax for
typecasting where you place the type you want inside parenthesis in
front of your more generic data - <em>(TreeViewItem) selected.Tag</em>.</p>
<p>One downside of storing data as an&nbsp;object is that you lose some
performance in the boxing/unboxing process when you typecast from a
basic type to a more specific type. That is really a minor issue
considering the major advantages you gain by being able to store
auxiliary information on a control itself.</p>
<p><strong>The FTPBrowser</strong><br>The program screenshot and code
snippets in this post came from a FTP Browser I am working on in my
spare time. You can see a very preliminary, non-feature complete
version (+ source) by clicking on the following link: <a title="WPF] FTP Browser (Beta)" href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=253751&amp;highlight=ftp"><u>WPF FTP Browser (Beta)</u></a>. Once I actually finish the application, I'll be sure to write about it it here.</p>

			<h3>April 9th, 2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.kirupa.com/?p=82#comments" class="commentslink" title="Comment on Streaming Audio to the Web via HTTP">11 Comments</a></h3>

		<div class="entrybody">
			<p>Have
you ever wanted to be an online equivalent of a radio DJ serving up
music for others to listen to? If you are like me, then you probably
haven't. But there are more practical uses to streaming your music from
a computer. You probably have or one day will be working on computers
do not belong to you. For example, a computer at your university lab,
workplace, relatives, etc. In those cases, you simply can't plop all of
your music from your portable music player and play it on the foreign
computer.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain how to stream music from your computer
via HTTP using&nbsp;the&nbsp;Windows Media Encoder. To listen back to
your music, as long as you (or others!) know your computer's IP
address, you can listen to your streaming music like you would tuning
into a radio station.</p>
<p>The following steps show you how it is done.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Downloading and Installing</strong><br>You'll need to download and install&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/encoder/default.mspx" target="_blank"><u>Windows Media Encoder</u></a>. The program works well in XP, but with Vista, the program's icons look a little weird and there are some minor glitches.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Broadcast&nbsp;a Live Event</strong><br>Once you launch the application, the New Session wizard will appear. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Broadcast a Live Event</strong> icon and press OK:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/newSession.png" border="1" height="159" width="282"> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Audio Device</strong><br>The next screen will
ask you to select which devices you want to use. Select Audio and in
the Audio&nbsp;drop-down menu, select default audio device and press
Next (we'll change this later):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/defaultAudioDevice.gif" border="1" height="134" width="276"> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Pull from the Encoder</strong><br>In this step, you
will be asked how you wish&nbsp;to broadcast the music. We just want to
request the music when we need it, so select the option for <strong>Pull music from encoder</strong> and press Next:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/pullEncoder.gif" border="1" height="145" width="310"> </p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Port and URL Information</strong><br>In the next
step, you can specify the HTTP port that will&nbsp;be used to stream
your music. The default value of 8080 is usually good, and you can also
view the URLs that you can use to connect to the stream:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/httpPort.gif" border="1" height="159" width="403"> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer doesn't connect to the internet directly (as in my
setup), the URL information won't be that helpful for non LAN based
connections. Click Next once you have specified a new HTTP port or
accepted the default HTTP port.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Specify Streaming Quality/Bitrate</strong><br>In the
next screen, you get to specify the bit rate of your streaming audio.
There are various settings you can pick, but be sure to pick one that
your internet connection supports. Rememeber, your current computer's
upload speed matters just as much as the listener computer's download
speed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/encodingAudio.gif" border="1" height="196" width="266"> </p>
<p>You can stop here by pressing Finish or make some more adjustments
by pressing Next. By pressing Next, you can choose whether to archive
your stream to a file and specify the tag information such as your
stream's name,&nbsp;details, etc.&nbsp;For the sake of brevity, click
Finish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Select Output Information</strong><br>After you
click Finish, you will be returned to the main Windows Media Encoder
window. From the toolbar at the top, press the Properties button. The
Sources tab should be selected by default with the Devices option under
"Source from" selected. </p>
<p>Under the Audio drop-down menu, select the menu option for what is
the equivalent of "What U Hear." You want to select the option that
streams whatever sound is played by your soundcard:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/audioSource.gif" border="1" height="250" width="390"> </p>
<p><strong>Step 8: It's Showtime</strong><br>You are almost done! Click
the Apply button, and after a few seconds, press the Start Encoding
button in your toolbar. You won't see anything happening unless you are
currently playing some music in the background. Launch your favorite
music application and start playing some music. You will see the
equalizers in Windows Media Encoder start to move.</p>
<p>You can mute your System sound and everything will still work
properly. The only thing you cannot mute is the actual application that
is playing the music (Windows Media Player, iTunes, WinAmp, etc.). I
know it sounds strange, but all of these sounds are being recorded and
played back internally. You hearing them is not that relevant...at
least on the server computer that is streaming the songs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Listening to the Stream</strong><br>To listen to the
music that is currently being played,&nbsp;use&nbsp;a media player that
can read Windows Media streams. I use Windows Media Player (WMP), so
from WMP, go to File | Open Url... and enter your IP address (<a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank"><u>find your IP address</u></a>)&nbsp;followed
by your port number (specified&nbsp;in Step 5) http://18.12.34.56:8080
where 18.12.34.56 is my IP address and the port number is 8080:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Reading%20XML%20Data%20Directly%20as%20Nodes%20and%20Elements_files/openURL.png" border="0" height="229" width="399"> &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few seconds of buffering, you should start to hear music
playing. The music that is playing is what is currently playing on your
computer running Windows Media Encoder.</p>
<p><strong>Loose Ends</strong><br>Phew - while the above looks like a
lot of work, it should only take you about 20 seconds to go from
launching Windows Media Encoder to having your Encoder listening for
sounds to stream. With that siad, there are some things that you should
keep in mind. </p>
<ul>
<li>To get the most out of this type of setup, you should enable Remote
Desktop on your server-like computer. That allows you to remotely
access Windows Media Encoder, change various settings, and more
importantly, alter what is being played.<br> 
</li><li>Remember that unlike radio stations, there is a limit to how
many people can connect to your computer to listen to your music. The
reason is that each person will be using up part of your upload
bandwidth, and many home broadband connections limit upstream speeds to
a fraction of the downstream speed.<br> 
</li><li>Finally, you may be asking why go through&nbsp;all this when
you already have Remote Desktop. After all, Remote Desktop allows
sounds generated by your remote computer to be played back&nbsp;on your
local machine. The reason is that the sound quality is usually really
poor. By using Windows Media Encoder, you are ensuring a reasonably
high sound quality with the option of adjusting it if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this article and the past few articles&nbsp;helped you to
better deal with the emptiness associated with being separated from
your primary computer for an extended period of time.</p>
