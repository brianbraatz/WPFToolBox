<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/200923.html">
yesterday's discussion</a>
of a digital clock program using data binding didn't imply that there
was only one way to implement a property that successfully serves as a
source in a data binding. There are at least three ways to do it.
</p>
<p>A brief overview: In WPF, a data binding links two properties of two
objects. One is considered the "target" of the data binding and the
other is the "source." There are several different "modes" of linking
these two properties together, but the most common (and generally the
default) is <i>BindingMode.OneWay</i>.  In this type of binding, whenever the source property changes, the target property is updated to reflect the new value.
</p>
<p>
Obviously there must exist some kind of mechanism for the source object
to notify the outside world when the bound property has changed.
Veteran .NET programmers will immediately shout out "Events!" and
that's certainly true. In pre-WPF days, such an event to signal a
change in a property is given the name of the property with the word <i>Changed</i> appended.
</p>
<p>
That approach still works in WPF. Here is an 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/alt1/ClockTicker.cs">alternative ClockTicker.cs</a> file that you can slip into yesterday's DigitalClock project and the clock will work just the same. This alternative <i>ClockTicker</i> class has a property named <i>DateTime</i> and an event named <i>DateTimeChanged</i>. The code in WPF responsible for implementing data bindings knows enough to look around (via reflection) for an event named <i>DateTimeChanged</i> when the source property is named <i>DateTime</i>. Notice that this is a <i>really</i> old-fashioned looking event because it's based on the <i>EventHandler</i> delegate. Nothing new about it.
</p>
<p>
The approach I showed yesterday (here's the original
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/ClockTicker.cs">ClockTicker.cs</a> file for your convenience) implements the <i>INotifyPropertyChanged</i> interface and has an event named <i>PropertyChanged</i>,
which identifies the particular event that's changed with a string.
This is a good approach to use if you have a bunch of properties that
might change because you only need one event for all of them.
</p>
<p>
The third approach is more "modern" and more "WPFish," and involves backing the property with an object of type <i>DependencyProperty</i>.  Here's yet another
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/03/alt2/ClockTicker.cs">alternative ClockTicker.cs</a> file that you use in the DigitalClock project.
A class that defines dependency properties must derive from <i>DependencyObject</i>. The dependency property gets the same name as the CLR property but with the word <i>Property</i> appended. The <i>DateTime</i> property is then implemented with calls to <i>GetValue</i> and <i>SetValue</i> defined by <i>DependencyObject</i>. (Complete details on defining dependency properties are in Chapter 8 of my forthcoming book 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf"><i>Applications = Code + Markup</i></a>).
</p>
<p>
What's interesting in the dependency property version of <i>ClockTicker</i> is the simplicity of the <i>TimerOnTick</i> handler. Rather than fire a new event, this one simply sets the <i>DateTime</i> property to its new value. That's enough to trigger activity within the data binding itself to update the target.
</p>
<p>Which approach is the best? Although defining dependency properties
is a PITA, it's really the way to go. Consider that target properties
of data bindings are <i>required</i> to be backed by dependency properties, and the choice is obvious.
